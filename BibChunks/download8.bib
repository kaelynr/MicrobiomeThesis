abstract={Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of complex microbial genomic DNA templates with degenerate primers can lead to distortion of the underlying community structure due to inefficient primer-template interactions leading to bias. We previously described a method of deconstructed PCR ("PEX PCR") to separate linear copying and exponential amplification stages of PCR to reduce PCR bias. In this manuscript, we describe an improved deconstructed PCR ("DePCR") protocol separating linear and exponential stages of PCR and allowing higher throughput of sample processing. We demonstrate that the new protocol shares the same benefits of the original and show that the protocol dramatically and significantly decreases the formation of chimeric sequences during PCR. By employing PCR with annealing temperature gradients, we further show that there is a strong negative correlation between annealing temperature and the evenness of primer utilization in a complex pool of degenerate primers. Shifting primer utilization patterns mirrored shifts in observed microbial community structure in a complex microbial DNA template. We further employed the DePCR method to amplify the same microbial DNA template independently with each primer variant from a degenerate primer pool. The non-degenerate primers generated a broad range of observed microbial communities, but some were highly similar to communities observed with degenerate primer pools. The same experiment conducted with standard PCR led to consistently divergent observed microbial community structure. The DePCR method is simple to perform, is limited to PCR mixes and cleanup steps, and is recommended for reactions in which degenerate primer pools are used or when mismatches between primers and template are possible.},

abstract={Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus species are relevant human commensals and opportunistic pathogens. Consequently, their bacteriophages may have significant impact on human microbial ecology and pathologies. Our aim was to reveal the prevalence and diversity of bacteriophages infecting Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus species that colonize the human body. Genome mining with comparative genomics, screening of clinical isolates, and profiling of metagenomes allowed characterization of 346 phages grouped in 52 clusters and 18 superclusters. Less than 10% of the identified phage clusters were represented by previously characterized phages. Prophage diversity patterns varied significantly for different phage types, host clades, and environmental niches. A more diverse phage community lysogenizes Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae strains than Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and "Haemophilus ducreyi". Co-infections occurred more often in "H. ducreyi". Phages from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans preferably lysogenized strains of specific serotype. Prophage patterns shared by subspecies clades of different bacterial species suggest similar ecoevolutionary drivers. Changes in frequencies of DNA uptake signal sequences and guanine-cytosine content reflect phage-host long-term coevolution. Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus phages were prevalent at multiple oral sites. Together, these findings should help exploring the ecoevolutionary forces shaping virus-host interactions in the human microbiome. Putative lytic phages, especially phiKZ-like, may provide new therapeutic options.},

abstract={Microbial communities play a central role in the N cycle of oceanic oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), such as in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP). We explored the spatial distribution of the genetic potential for ammonia oxidation (amoA gene for bacteria and archaea), denitrification (nirS and nirK), anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) (hzo) and dissimilarity nitrate reduction to ammonia (DNRA) (nrfA) and their relationships with the hydrological variables and isotopic composition of nitrate in the ETNP off Mexico. Oxygen concentration, the availability of N chemical forms and the upwelling shaped the distribution of N cycling genes along the water column. The high abundance of N genes and the isotopic composition of nitrate suggest the N cycling is very dynamic in the OMZ core. The accumulation of nitrite, the high abundance of archaeal amoA genes, and the deviation of the N and O isotopes of nitrate from the expected 1:1 ratio for nitrate reduction in the upper portion of this OMZ indicate that nitrification is a relevant process that fuels the denitrifier community. Conversely, the high abundances of nitrate, ammonium and nrfA genes in the deeper layer indicate that DNRA is a crucial process enhancing anammox there. These results show the need for more detailed studies of the N processes in OMZs.},

abstract={The aim of the study was to determine the impact of biological treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies (anti-TNF-alpha) on the intestinal microbiome of children with severe Crohn's disease (CD) and to evaluate the differences in the intestinal microbiome between patients treated with biological therapy and healthy children. Microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microbial profiles were compared between studied groups. Fifty-four samples (from 18 patients before and after anti-TNF-alpha induction therapy and 18 healthy children) were used in the sequencing analysis. Shannon's diversity index (p = 0.003, adj. p = 0.010) and observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (p = 0.007, adj. p = 0.015) were different between controls and patients with prior therapy for CD. Statistically significant dissimilarities between beta diversity metrics, indicating distinct community composition across groups, were observed in patients with CD before and after therapy. We did not observe any differences between controls and patients with CD after therapy. Core microbiome analysis at species level showed that 32 species were present only in patients with CD but not in controls. The results show that biological treatment is associated with changes in the intestinal microbiome of patients with CD: these changes result in an intestinal microbiome pattern similar to that seen in healthy children. Long-term observation is necessary to determine whether treatment can lead to full restoration of a healthy-like microbiome.},

abstract={Fungal endophytes of plants are ubiquitous and important to host plant health. Wood-inhabiting and foliar endophyte communities from multiple tree hosts were sampled at multiple spatial scales across the Fushan forest dynamics plot in northern Taiwan, using culture-free, community DNA amplicon sequencing methods. Fungal endophyte communities were distinct between leaves and wood, but the mycobiomes were highly variable across and within tree species. Despite this, host tree species was an important predictor of mycobiome community-composition. Within a single common tree species, “core” mycobiomes were characterized using co-occurrence analysis. The spatial co-occurrence patterns of these few species of fungal endophytes appear to explain the strong host effect. For wood endophytes, a consistent core mycobiome coexisted with the host across the extent of the study. For leaf endophytes, the core fungi resembled a more dynamic, “gradient” model of the core microbiome, changing across the topography and distance of the study.},
