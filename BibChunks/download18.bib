abstract={Cetacean represent vulnerable species impacted by multiple stressors, including reduction in prey species, habitat destruction, whaling and infectious disease. The composition of blow microbiota has been claimed to provide a promising tool for non-invasive health monitoring aiming to inform conservation management. Still, little is known about the temporal stability and composition of blow microbiota in whales. We used East Australian humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) as a model species and collected blow and control samples in August 2016 and 2017 for an interannual comparison. We analysed the blow by barcode tag sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that the microbial communities in 2016 and 2017 were statistically similar regarding alpha and beta diversity but distinct to seawater. Zero-radius operational taxonomic units (zOTUs) shared by both groups accounted for about 50% of all zOTUs present. Still, the large individual variability in the blow microbiota resulted in a small number of core taxa (defined as present in at least 60% of whales). We conclude that the blow microbiota of humpback whales is either generally limited and of transient nature or the reduced airway microbiota is the symptom of a compromised physiological state potentially due to the challenges of the whales' annual migration.},

abstract={Huntington's disease is characterized by a triad of motor, cognitive and psychiatric impairments, as well as unintended weight loss. Although much of the research has focused on cognitive, motor and psychiatric symptoms, the extent of peripheral pathology and the relationship between these factors, and the core symptoms of Huntington's disease, are relatively unknown. Gut microbiota are key modulators of communication between the brain and gut, and alterations in microbiota composition (dysbiosis) can negatively affect cognition, behaviour and affective function, and may be implicated in disease progression. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis was recently reported in Huntington's disease transgenic mice. Our main objective was to characterize the gut microbiome in people with Huntington's disease and determine whether the composition of gut microbiota are significantly related to clinical indicators of disease progression. We compared 42 Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers, including 19 people who were diagnosed with Huntington's disease (Total Functional Capacity > 6) and 23 in the premanifest stage, with 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants were characterized clinically using a battery of cognitive tests and using results from 16S V3 to V4 rRNA sequencing of faecal samples to characterize the gut microbiome. For gut microbiome measures, we found significant differences in the microbial communities (beta diversity) based on unweighted UniFrac distance (P = 0.001), as well as significantly lower alpha diversity (species richness and evenness) between our combined Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group and healthy controls (P = 0.001). We also found major shifts in the microbial community structure at Phylum and Family levels, and identified functional pathways and enzymes affected in our Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group. Within the Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group, we also discovered associations among gut bacteria, cognitive performance and clinical outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest an altered gut microbiome in Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers. These results highlight the importance of gut biomarkers and raise interesting questions regarding the role of the gut in Huntington's disease, and whether it may be a potential target for future therapeutic intervention.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: In social insects, identical genotypes can show extreme lifespan variation providing a unique perspective on age-associated microbial succession. In honey bees, short- and long-lived host phenotypes are polarized by a suite of age-associated factors including hormones, nutrition, immune senescence, and oxidative stress. Similar to other model organisms, the aging gut microbiota of short-lived (worker) honey bees accrue Proteobacteria and are depleted of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, consistent with a suite of host senescence markers. In contrast, long-lived (queen) honey bees maintain youthful cellular function with much lower expression of oxidative stress genes, suggesting a very different host environment for age-associated microbial succession. RESULTS: We sequenced the microbiota of 63 honey bee queens exploring two chronological ages and four alimentary tract niches. To control for genetic and environmental variation, we quantified carbonyl accumulation in queen fat body tissue as a proxy for biological aging. We compared our results to the age-specific microbial succession of worker guts. Accounting for queen source variation, two or more bacterial species per niche differed significantly by queen age. Biological aging in queens was correlated with microbiota composition highlighting the relationship of microbiota with oxidative stress. Queens and workers shared many major gut bacterial species, but differ markedly in community structure and age succession. In stark contrast to aging workers, carbonyl accumulation in queens was significantly associated with increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and depletion of various Proteobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: We present a model system linking changes in gut microbiota to diet and longevity, two of the most confounding variables in human microbiota research. The pattern of age-associated succession in the queen microbiota is largely the reverse of that demonstrated for workers. The guts of short-lived worker phenotypes are progressively dominated by three major Proteobacteria, but these same species were sparse or significantly depleted in long-lived queen phenotypes. More broadly, age-related changes in the honey bee microbiota reflect the regulatory anatomy of reproductive host metabolism. Our synthesis suggests that the evolution of colony-level reproductive physiology formed the context for host-microbial interactions and age-related succession of honey bee microbiota.},

abstract={Fecal microbes play an important role in the survival and health of wild animals. Spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) is one of the representative carnivores in Africa. In this study, we examined the fecal microflora of spotted hyena by conducting high-throughput sequencing of the fecal microbial 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 high mutation region. The effects of age, sex, and feeding environment on the fecal microbiota of spotted hyenas were determined. The results showed that the core bacteria phyla of spotted hyenas fecal microbiota include Firmicutes (at an average relative abundance of 53.93%), Fusobacteria (19.56%), Bacteroidetes (11.40%), Actinobacteria (5.78%), and Proteobacteria (3.26%), etc. Age, gender, and feeding environment all had important effects on the fecal microbiota of spotted hyenas, among which feeding environment might be the most significant. The abundance of the Firmicutes in the adult group was significantly higher than that in the juvenile group, whereas the abundance of Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were significantly lower than that in the juvenile group. The abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae in the female group was significantly higher than that in the male group. There were significant differences between the fecal microbial communities of Jinan group and Weihai group, and microbes from the phyla Firmicutes and Synergistetes were representative species associated with the difference.},

abstract={OBJECTIVES: Both genetic and environmental factors are conceivably required to assess the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), yet little is known regarding the relationship between oral microbiome and the mutational spectrum of OSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to study the composition of oral microorganisms in OSCC patients, whose cancer mutational profiles were previously defined by whole-exome sequencing, to evaluate the relationship between oral microbiome and the mutational changes in OSCC. RESULTS: Analyzing the contributions of the five mutational signatures extracted from the primary tumors revealed three groups of OSCC (mutational signature cluster, MSC1-3) that were significantly associated with demographic and clinical features. Taxonomic analysis of the predominant phyla in salivary samples showed variation in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the three MSC groups. In addition, significant differences in bacterial species richness (alpha diversity) and slight sample-to-sample dissimilarities in bacterial community structures (beta diversity) were noted among different MSC groups. Further, predicting the functional capabilities of microbial communities by reconstruction of unobserved states showed that many pathways related to cell motility were differentially enriched among the three MSC groups. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results indicate a potential association of oral microbiome with the mutational changes in OSCC.},
