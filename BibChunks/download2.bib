abstract={Endolithic growth within rocks is a critical adaptation of microbes living in harsh environments where exposure to extreme temperature, radiation, and desiccation limits the predominant life forms, such as in the ice-free regions of Continental Antarctica. The microbial diversity of the endolithic communities in these areas has been sparsely examined. In this work, diversity and composition of bacterial assemblages in the cryptoendolithic lichen-dominated communities of Victoria Land (Continental Antarctica) were explored using a high-throughput metabarcoding approach, targeting the V4 region of 16S rDNA. Rocks were collected in 12 different localities (from 14 different sites), along a gradient ranging from 1000 to 3300 m a.s.l. and at a sea distance ranging from 29 to 96 km. The results indicate Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are the dominant taxa in all samples and defined a 'core' group of bacterial taxa across all sites. The structure of bacteria communities is correlated with the fungal counterpart and among the environmental parameters considered, altitude was found to influence bacterial biodiversity, while distance from sea had no evident influence.},

abstract={Bacterial communities are fundamental symbionts of corals. However, the process by which bacterial communities are acquired across the life history of corals, particularly in larval and early juvenile stages, is still poorly characterized. Here, transfer of bacteria of the Scleractinian coral Acropora digitifera from adults to spawned egg-sperm bundles was analyzed, as well as acquisition across early developmental stages (larvae and newly settled spat), and 6-month-old juveniles. Larvae were reared under manipulated environmental conditions to determine the source (maternal, seawater, or sediment) of bacteria likely to establish symbiotic relationships with the host using amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Maternal colonies directly transferred bacteria from the families Rhodobacteraceae, Cryomorphaceae, and Endozoicimonaceae to egg-sperm bundles. Furthermore, significant differences in the microbial community structure were identified across generations, yet the structure of the coral bacterial community across early life history stages was not impacted by different environmental rearing conditions. These data indicate that the uptake and structure of bacterial communities is developmentally, rather than environmentally, regulated. Both maternal coral colonies and ubiquitous bacteria found across environmental substrates represent a potential source of symbionts important in establishing the coral microbiome. Uniquely, we report the presence of variation with ontogeny of both the core and resident bacterial communities, supporting the hypothesis that microbial communities are likely to play specific roles within the distinct life history stages of the coral host.},

abstract={Gut microbiota are important for various aspects of host physiology, and its composition is generally influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic contexts of the host. Social bee gut microbiota composition is simple and highly stable hypothesized to be due to their unique food habit and social interactions. Here, we focused on hornets, the largest of the eusocial wasps - Vespa mandarinia and V. simillima. Unlike the well-studied honey bees, adult hornets are generally herbivorous but also hunt insects for broods, a unique behavior which could influence their gut microbiota. Analysis of the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the two species have simple gut microbiota, composed of seven or eight consistently maintained 'core' operational taxonomic units (OTUs). While the two Vespa species shared some OTUs, the structures of their gut communities differed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated association of core OTUs with host diet. Intriguingly, prey honey bee gut microbes were detected in the V. simillima gut (and to a lesser extent in V. mandarinia), suggesting migration of microorganisms from the prey gut. This is the first report uncovering gut microbiome in hornets, giving additional insight into how food habit affects gut microbiota of social insects.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Neointimal hyperplasia is a major contributor to restenosis after arterial interventions, but the genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying the variable propensity for neointimal hyperplasia between individuals, including the role of commensal microbiota, are not well understood. We sought to characterize how shifting the microbiome using cage sharing and bedding mixing between rats with differing restenosis phenotypes after carotid artery balloon angioplasty could alter arterial remodeling. METHODS: We co-housed and mixed bedding between genetically distinct rats (Lewis [LE] and Sprague-Dawley [SD]) that harbor different commensal microbes and that are known to have different neointimal hyperplasia responses to carotid artery balloon angioplasty. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was used to monitor changes in the gut microbiome. RESULTS: There were significant differences in neointimal hyperplasia between non-co-housed LE and SD rats 14 days after carotid artery angioplasty (mean intima + media [I + M] area, 0.117 +/- 0.014 mm(2) LE vs 0.275 +/- 0.021 mm(2) SD; P < .001) that were diminished by co-housing. Co-housing also altered local adventitial Ki67 immunoreactivity, local accumulation of leukocytes and macrophages (total and M2), and interleukin 17A concentration 3 days after surgery in each strain. Non-co-housed SD and LE rats had microbiomes distinguished by both weighted (P = .012) and unweighted (P < .001) UniFrac beta diversity distances, although without significant differences in alpha diversity. The difference in unweighted beta diversity between the fecal microbiota of SD and LE rats was significantly reduced by co-housing. Operational taxonomic units that significantly correlated with average I + M area include Parabacteroides distasonis, Desulfovibrio, Methanosphaera, Peptococcus, and Prevotella. Finally, serum concentrations of microbe-derived metabolites hydroxyanthranilic acid and kynurenine/tryptophan ratio were significantly associated with I + M area in both rat strains independent of co-housing. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel mechanism for how microbiome manipulations affect arterial remodeling and the inflammatory response after arterial injury. A greater understanding of the host inflammatory-microbe axis could uncover novel therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of restenosis.},

abstract={Multicellular organisms, including plants, are colonized by microorganisms, some of which are beneficial to growth and health. The assembly rules for establishing plant microbiota are not well understood, and neither is the extent to which their members interact. We conducted drop-out and late introduction experiments by inoculating Arabidopsis thaliana with synthetic communities from a resource of 62 native bacterial strains to test how arrival order shapes community structure. As a read-out we tracked the relative abundance of all strains in the phyllosphere of individual plants. Our results showed that community assembly is historically contingent and subject to priority effects. Missing strains could, to various degrees, invade an already established microbiota, which was itself resistant and remained largely unaffected by latecomers. Additionally, our results indicate that individual strains of Proteobacteria (Sphingomonas, Rhizobium) and Actinobacteria (Microbacterium, Rhodococcus) have the greatest potential to affect community structure as keystone species.},
