abstract={Seasonal changes in the environment, such as varying temperature, have the potential to change the functional relationship between ectothermic animals, such as insects, and their microbiomes. Our objectives were to determine: (a) whether seasonal changes in temperature shift the composition of the insect gut microbiome, and (b) whether changes in the microbiome are concomitant with changes in the physiology of the host, including the immune system and response to cold. We exposed laboratory populations of the spring field cricket, Gryllus veletis (Orthoptera: Gryllidae), to simulated overwintering conditions in both a laboratory microcosm and a field‚Äêlike microcosm containing soil and leaves. In summer, autumn, winter and spring, we extracted and sequenced 16S bacterial genomic DNA from cricket guts, to capture seasonal variation in the composition of the microbiome. The composition of the gut microbiome was similar between microcosms, and overall highly anaerobic. In both microcosms, we captured similar seasonal variation in the composition of the microbiome, where overwintering resulted in permanent changes to these microbial communities. In particular, the abundance of Pseudomonas spp. decreased, and that of Wolbachia spp. increased, during overwintering. Concurrent with overwintering changes in the gut microbiome, G. veletis acquire freeze tolerance and immune function shifts temporarily, returning to summer levels of activity in the spring. In a specific manner, haemocyte concentrations increase but survival of fungal infection decreases in the winter, whereas the ability to clear bacteria from the haemolymph remains unchanged. Overall, we demonstrate that the gut microbiome does shift seasonally, and in concert with other physiological changes. We hypothesize that these changes may be linked, and suggest that it will next be important to determine whether these changes in the microbiome contribute to host overwintering success.},

abstract={The extraradical hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) harbour and interact with a microbial community performing multiple functions. However, how the AMF-microbiome interaction influences the phosphorus (P) acquisition efficiency of the mycorrhizal pathway is unclear. Here we investigated whether AMF and their hyphal microbiome play a role in promoting organic phosphorus (P) mineralizing under field conditions. We developed an AMF hyphae in-growth core system for the field using PVC tubes sealed with membrane with different size of pores (30 or 0.45 mum) to allow or deny AMF hyphae access to a patch of organic P in root-free soil. AMF and their hyphae associated microbiome played a role in enhancing soil organic P mineralization in situ in the field, which was shown to be a function of the change in bacteria community on the hyphae surface. The bacterial communities attached to the AMF hyphae surface were significantly different from those in the bulk soil. Importantly, AMF hyphae recruited bacteria that produced alkaline phosphatase and provided a function that was absent from the hyphae. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding trophic interactions to be able to gain insight into the functional controls of nutrient cycles in the rhizosphere.},

abstract={The gut microbiome is recognised as playing an integral role in the health and ecology of a wide variety of animal taxa. However, the relationship between social behavioural traits and the microbial community has received little attention. Honey bees are highly social and the workers perform different behavioural tasks in the colony that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. Here we examined whether the gut microbial community composition of worker honey bees is associated with the behavioural tasks they perform, and therefore also the local environment they are exposed to. We set up five observation hives, in which all workers were matched in age and observed the behaviour of marked bees in each colony over 4 days. The gut bacterial communities of bees seen performing predominantly foraging or predominantly in nest tasks were then characterised and compared based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Our results show that some core members of the unique honey bee gut bacterial community are represented in different relative abundances in bees performing different behavioural tasks. The differentially represented bacterial taxa include some thought to be important in carbohydrate metabolism and transport, and also linked to bee health. The results suggest an influence of task-related local environment exposure and diet on the honey bee gut microbial community and identify focal core taxa for further functional analyses.},

abstract={Ecological processes shaping the structure and diversity of microbial communities are of practical importance for managing the function and resilience of engineered biological ecosystems such as activated sludge processes. This study systematically evaluated the ecological processes acting during continuous exposure to a subinhibitory level of antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) as an environmental stressor. 16S rRNA gene-based community profiling revealed significant perturbations on the community structure and dramatic reduction (by 20-30%) in species diversity/richness compared to those under the control conditions. In addition, community profiling determined the prevalence of the deterministic processes overwhelming the ecological stochasticity. Analysis of both community composition and phenotypes in the TCS-exposed communities suggested the detailed deterministic mechanism: selection of TCS degrading (Sphingopyxis) and resistant (Pseudoxanthomonas) bacterial populations. The analysis also revealed a significant reduction of core activated sludge members, Chitinophagaceae (e.g., Ferruginibacter) and Comamonadaceae (e.g., Acidovorax), potentially affecting ecosystem functions (e.g., floc formation and nutrient removal) directly associated with system performance (i.e., wastewater treatment efficiency and effluent quality). Overall, our study provides new findings that inform the mechanisms underlying the community structure and diversity of activated sludge, which not only advances the current understanding of microbial ecology in activated sludge, but also has practical implications for the design and operation of environmental bioprocesses for treatment of antimicrobial-bearing waste streams.},

abstract={Sponges harbor characteristic microbiomes derived from symbiotic relationships shaping their lifestyle and survival. Haliclona fulva is encrusting marine sponge species dwelling in coralligenous accretions or semidark caves of the Mediterranean Sea and the near Atlantic Ocean. In this work, we characterized the abundance and core microbial community composition found in specimens of H. fulva by means of electron microscopy and 16S amplicon Illumina sequencing. We provide evidence of its low microbial abundance (LMA) nature. We found that the H. fulva core microbiome is dominated by sequences belonging to the orders Nitrosomonadales and Cenarchaeales. Seventy percent of the reads assigned to these phylotypes grouped in a very small number of high-frequency operational taxonomic units, representing niche-specific species Cenarchaeum symbiosum and uncultured Betaproteobacteria HF1, a new eubacterial ribotype variant found in H. fulva. The microbial composition of H. fulva is quite distinct from those reported in sponge species of the same Haliclona genus. We also detected evidence of an excretion/capturing loop between these abundant microorganisms and planktonic microbes by analyzing shifts in seawater planktonic microbial content exposed to healthy sponge specimens maintained in aquaria. Our results suggest that horizontal transmission is very likely the main mechanism for symbionts' acquisition by H. fulva. So far, this is the first shallow water sponge species harboring such a specific and predominant assemblage composed of these eubacterial and archaeal ribotypes. Our data suggests that this symbiotic relationship is very stable over time, indicating that the identified core microbial symbionts may play key roles in the holobiont functioning.},
