abstract={This paper presents study on the microbiome of a unique extreme environment - saline and alkaline lime, a by-product of soda ash and table salt production in Janikowo, central Poland. High-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was used to reveal the structure of bacterial and archaeal communities in the lime samples, taken from repository ponds differing in salinity (2.3-25.5% NaCl). Surprisingly abundant and diverse bacterial communities were discovered in this extreme environment. The most important geochemical drivers of the observed microbial diversity were salinity, calcium ions, nutrients, and water content. The bacterial and archaeal communities in saline, alkaline lime were similar to those found in natural haloalkaline environments. Although the archaeal contribution to the whole microbial community was lower than 4%, the four archaeal genera Natronomonas, Halorubrum, Halobellus, and Halapricum constituted the core microbiome of saline, alkaline lime - a set of OTUs (> 0.1% of total archaeal relative abundance) present in all samples under study. The high proportion of novel, unclassified archaeal and bacterial sequences (not identified at 97% similarity level) in the 16S rRNA gene libraries indicated that potentially new genera, especially within the class of Thermoplasmata inhabit this unique environment.},

abstract={Deep sequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene amplicons continues to be the most common approach for characterization of complex microbial communities. PCR amplifications of conserved regions of SSU rRNA genes often employ degenerate pools of primers to enable targeting of a broad spectrum of organisms. One little noticed feature of such degenerate primer sets is the potential for a wide range of melting temperatures between the primer variants. The melting temperature variation of primers in a degenerate pool could lead to variable amplification efficiencies and PCR bias. Thus, we sought to adjust the melting temperature of each primer variant individually. Individual primer modifications were used to reduce theoretical melting temperature variation between primers, as well as to introduce inter-cluster nucleotide diversity during Illumina sequencing of primer regions. We demonstrate here the suitability of such primers for microbial community analysis. However, no substantial differences in microbial community structure were revealed when using primers with adjusted melting temperatures, though the optimal annealing temperature decreased.},

abstract={As a traditional fermented cereal, Inner Mongolian acidic gruel has a unique flavor and rich nutrition, but the microbial diversity of acidic gruel and the microbial differences among the products in different regions have not been reported. The bacterial diversity and the lactic acid bacteria species of 27 types of traditional handmade acidic gruel were evaluated using a combination of MiSeq high-throughput sequencing and PCR-DGGE. All 358,205 high-quality 16S rRNA reads were divided into 25,171 OTUs under the similarity of 97%. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla, and the core dominant genera were Lactobacillus and Acetobacter with average relative abundances of 64.06% and 24.13%, respectively. The primary genera that caused the differences in the bacterial community structure between the Bayan Nur and Ordos acidic gruel samples were Pseudomonas, Leuconostoc, and Acinetobacter as revealed by redundancy analysis (RDA). PCR-DGGE analyses revealed that the lactic acid bacteria in both the Bayan Nur and Ordos samples of acidic gruel were Lactobacillus (L.) amylolyticus, L. alimentarius, L. fermentum, L. hamsteri, L. helveticus, L. panis, L. plantarum, L. pontis, and Leuconostoc lactis. In addition, L. hamsteri was the core strain detected among all the samples. The results deepened the understanding of the microbial community composition and the diversity of acidic gruel to provide a theoretical basis for the preservation and protection of microbial resources in acidic gruel in the Inner Mongolia area.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The microbiome of the built environment has important implications for human health and wellbeing; however, bidirectional exchange of microbes between occupants and surfaces can be confounded by lifestyle, architecture, and external environmental exposures. Here, we present a longitudinal study of United States Air Force Academy cadets (n = 34), which have substantial homogeneity in lifestyle, diet, and age, all factors that influence the human microbiome. We characterized bacterial communities associated with (1) skin and gut samples from roommate pairs, (2) four built environment sample locations inside the pairs' dormitory rooms, (3) four built environment sample locations within shared spaces in the dormitory, and (4) room-matched outdoor samples from the window ledge of their rooms. RESULTS: We analyzed 2,170 samples, which generated 21,866 unique amplicon sequence variants. Linear convergence of microbial composition and structure was observed between an occupants' skin and the dormitory surfaces that were only used by that occupant (i.e., desk). Conversely, bacterial community beta diversity (weighted Unifrac) convergence between the skin of both roommates and the shared dormitory floor between the two cadet's beds was not seen across the entire study population. The sampling period included two semester breaks in which the occupants vacated their rooms; upon their return, the beta diversity similarity between their skin and the surfaces had significantly decreased compared to before the break (p < 0.05). There was no apparent convergence between the gut and building microbiota, with the exception of communal bathroom door-handles, which suggests that neither co-occupancy, diet, or lifestyle homogenization had a significant impact on gut microbiome similarity between these cadets over the observed time frame. As a result, predictive classifier models were able to identify an individual more accurately based on the gut microbiota (74%) compared to skin (51%). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show an increase in skin microbial similarity of two individuals who start living together for the first time and who are not genetically related or romantically involved. Cohabitation was significantly associated with increased skin microbiota similarity but did not significantly influence the gut microbiota. Following a departure from the occupied space of several weeks, the skin microbiota, but not the gut microbiota, showed a significant reduction in similarity relative to the building. Overall, longitudinal observation of these dynamics enables us to dissect the influence of occupation, diet, and lifestyle factors on occupant and built environment microbial ecology.},

abstract={The ecological interactions within the gut microbial communities are complex and far from being fully understood. Here we report the first study that aims at defining the interaction network of the gut microbiota in pigs and comparing it with the enterotype-like clustering analysis. Fecal microbiota of 518 healthy piglets was characterized by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Two networks were constructed at the genus and operational taxonomic unit levels. Within-network interactions mirrored the human gut microbiota relationships, with a strong co-exclusion between Prevotella and Ruminococcus genera, and were consistent with the two enterotype-like clusters identified in the pig microbiota. Remarkably, the cluster classification of the individuals was significantly associated with the body weight at 60 days of age (P=0.005) and average daily gain (P=0.027). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an integrated overview of the porcine gut microbiota that suggests a conservation of the ecological community interactions and functional architecture between humans and pig. Moreover, we show that the microbial ecosystems and porcine growth traits are linked, which allows us to foresee that the enterotype concept may have an important role in the animal production industry.},
