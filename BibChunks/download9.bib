abstract={With increasing fresh water (FW) scarcity, the use of treated wastewater (TWW) for crop irrigation is expanding globally. Besides clear benefits, some undesired long-term effects of irrigation with this low quality water on plant performance have been reported. As the rhizosphere microbiome can mediate plant-soil interactions, an examination of the response of these organisms to TWW is necessary to understand the full effects of water quality. In the current study, the effects of irrigation water quality on the microbial community structure of soil and roots as well as edaphic properties and plant performance were evaluated. We compared soil and roots microbiomes of two different plant species (tomato and lettuce), each grown in two distinct soils, and irrigated with either FW or TWW. Irrigation with TWW significantly increase soil pH, EC, K, Na and DOC, and decrease plant fruit and shoot weight, relatively to samples irrigated with FW. We calculated the effect size of plant species, soil type, and irrigation water quality on microbial community structure in soil and root. In the roots, plant species and irrigation water were the dominant factors in shaping both total (DNA based) and active (RNA based) microbial communities, with both factors contributing similarly to the observed microbial population. Soil type and irrigation water were the dominant factors shaping the total microbial community in the soil and were of similar magnitude. Irrigation water quality is demonstrated to be a major force in shaping root-associated microbiome, leading to altered microbial community structure in the critical juncture between plant and soil.},

abstract={Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become a worldwide health issue. Recent studies reveal that the human gut microbiota exerts a significant role in the pathogenesis of this disease. While drug treatments may greatly improve metabolic symptoms, little is known about the gut microbiota composition of these treated MetS patients. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota composition of treated-MetS patients and analyse the possibility of using gut microbiota as an indicator of metabolic conditions. 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing approach was used to profile gut microbiota of 111 treated MetS patients from The Cohort of patients at a high Risk of Cardiovascular Events (CORE)-Thailand registry. Our results show that the gut microbiota profiles of MetS patients are diverse across individuals, but can be classified based on their similarity into three groups or enterotypes. We also showed several associations between species abundance and metabolic parameters that are enterotype specific. These findings suggest that information on the gut microbiota can be useful for assessing treatment options for MetS patients. In addition, any correlations between species abundance and human properties are likely specific to each microbial community.},

abstract={Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a significant role in the establishment and resilience of vegetation in harsh environments, such as volcanic slopes, in which soil is frequently disturbed by ash falling and erosion. We characterized AM fungal communities associated with a pioneer grass in a volcanic slope based on the disturbance tolerance of the fungi, addressing the hypothesis that soil disturbance is a major ecological filter for AM fungi in volcanic ecosystems and, thus, fungi that are more tolerant to soil disturbance are selected at higher elevations (i.e. nearer to the crater). Paired soil-core samples were collected from the rhizosphere of Miscanthus sinensis between the vegetation limit and forest limit on a volcanic slope and used in a trap culture with M. sinensis seedlings, in which one of the paired samples was sieved to destroy hyphal networks (disturbance treatment), while the other was not (intact treatment). Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse for two months, and the roots were subjected to molecular analysis of fungal communities. AM fungal diversity decreased with increasing elevations, in which nested structure was observed. Community dissimilarity between the disturbed and intact communities decreased with increasing elevations, suggesting that communities at higher elevations were more robust against soil disturbance. These results suggest that AM fungi that are more tolerant to soil disturbance are more widely distributed across the ecosystem, that is, they are generalists. The wide distribution of disturbance-tolerant fungi may have significant implications for the rapid resilience of vegetation after disturbance in the ecosystem.},

abstract={Previous studies dealing with changes in microbial communities during vermicomposting were mostly performed at lab-scale conditions and by using low-throughput techniques. Therefore, we sought to characterize the bacterial succession during the vermicomposting of grape marc over a period of 91 days in a pilot-scale vermireactor. Samples were taken at the initiation of vermicomposting, and days 14, 28, 42, and 91, representing both active and mature stages of vermicomposting. By using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing, significant changes in the bacterial community composition of grape marc were found after 14 days and throughout the process (p < 0.0001). There was also an increase in bacterial diversity, both taxonomic and phylogenetic, from day 14 until the end of the trial. We found the main core microbiome comprised of twelve bacterial taxa (~16.25% of the total sequences) known to be capable of nitrogen fixation and to confer plant-disease suppression. Accordingly, functional diversity included increases in specific genes related to nitrogen fixation and synthesis of plant hormones (salicylic acid) after 91 days. Together, the findings support the use of grape marc vermicompost for sustainable practices in the wine industry by disposing of this high-volume winery by-product and capturing its value to improve soil fertility.},

abstract={Phlebotomine sand flies are remarkable vectors of several etiologic agents (virus, bacterial, trypanosomatid Leishmania), posing a heavy health burden for human populations mainly located at developing countries. Their intestinal microbiota is involved in a wide range of biological and physiological processes, and could exclude or facilitate such transmission of pathogens. In this study, we investigated the Eubacterial microbiome from digestive tracts of Lu. evansi adults structure using 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) obtained from digestive tracts of Lu. evansi adults. The samples were collected at two locations with high incidence of the disease in humans: peri-urban and forest ecosystems from the department of Sucre, Colombia. 289,068 quality-filtered reads of V4 region of 16S rRNA gene were obtained and clustered into 1,762 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% similarity. Regarding eubacterial diversity, 14 bacterial phyla and 2 new candidate phyla were found to be consistently associated with the gut microbiome content. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in all the samples and the core microbiome was particularly dominated by Methylobacterium genus. Methylobacterium species, are known to have mutualistic relationships with some plants and are involved in shaping the microbial community in the phyllosphere. As a remarkable feature, OTUs classified as Wolbachia spp. were found abundant on peri-urban ecosystem samples, in adult male (OTUs n = 776) and unfed female (OTUs n = 324). Furthermore, our results provide evidence of OTUs classified as Cardinium endosymbiont in relative abundance, notably higher with respect to Wolbachia. The variation in insect gut microbiota may be determined by the environment as also for the type of feeding. Our findings increase the richness of the microbiota associated with Lu. evansi. In this study, OTUs of Methylobacterium found in Lu. evansi was higher in engorged females, suggesting that there are interactions between microbes from plant sources, blood nutrients and the parasites they transmit during the blood intake.},
