# MicrobiomeThesis README
This project is an exploratory literature search in the field of microbial ecology. It is based off the five general definitions of a core microbiome as proposed by Alice Risely in 2020; the common core, the temporal core, the ecological core, the functional core, and the host-adapted core. This study aims to assign characteristics to each definition of the core microbiome through quantitative extraction from microbiome research papers.
