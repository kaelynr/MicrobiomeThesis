abstract={The aim of this study was to gain insight into the bacterial composition and dynamics in a mineral water treatment system (MWTS). The bacterial community of a full-scale mineral water treatment plant in the Maofeng Mountain, South China, was studied using high-throughput sequencing combined with cultivation-based techniques in both the dry and wet season. Overall, adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) concentration (6.47 x 10(-11) - 3.32 x 10(-8) M) and heterotrophic plate counts (HPC) (3 - 1.29 x 10(3) CFU/mL) of water samples in the wet season were lower than those (ATP concentration 5.10 x 10(-11) - 6.96 x 10(-8) M, HPC 2 - 1.97 x 10(3) CFU/mL) in the dry season throughout the whole MWTS. The microbial activity and biomass of water samples obviously changed along with treatment process. All 300 isolates obtained using cultivation-based techniques were distributed in 5 phyla, 7 classes, and 19 genera. Proteobacteria accounted for 55.7% (167) of the total isolates, among which predominant genus was Pseudomonas (19.3%). Illumina sequencing analysis of 16s rRNA genes revealed 15 bacterial phyla (relative abundance >0.1%) as being identified in all water samples. Among these, Proteobacteria constituted the dominant bacteria microbiota in all water samples. A large shift in the proportion of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes was obtained during the treatment process, with the proportion of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria decreasing sharply, whereas that of Firmicutes increased and predominated in the final water product. The core microbiome, which was still present in whole MWTS comprised several genera including Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Clostridium, and Mycobacterium, that contain species that are opportunistic pathogens, suggesting a potential threat for mineral water microbiology safety. This study is the first to investigate the bacterial community of a full-scale mineral water treatment plant in China. The results provided data regarding the bacteria composition and dynamics in an MWTS, which will contribute to the beneficial manipulation of the mineral water microbiome.},

abstract={Bats and their associated guano microbiota provide important terrestrial and subterranean ecosystem services and serve as a reservoir for a wide range of epizootic and zoonotic diseases. Unfortunately, large-scale studies of bats and their guano microbiotas are limited by the time and cost of sample collection, which requires specially trained individuals to work at night to capture bats when they are most active. Indirectly surveying bat gut microbiota through guano deposits could be a more cost-effective alternative, but it must first be established whether the postdefecation exposure to an aerobic environment has a large impact on the guano microbial community. A number of recent studies on mammalian feces have shown that the impact of aerobic exposure is highly species specific; therefore, it is difficult to predict how exposure will affect the bat guano microbiota without empirical data. In our study, we collected fresh guano samples from 24 individuals of 10 bat species that are common throughout the arid environments of the American southwest and subjected the samples to 0, 1, and 12 hr of exposure. The biodiversity decreased rapidly after the shift from an anaerobic to an aerobic environment-much faster than previously reported in mammalian species. However, the relative composition of the core guano microbiota remained stable and, using highly sensitive targeted PCR methods, we found that pathogens present in the original, non-exposed samples could still be recovered after 12 hr of exposure. These results suggest that with careful sample analysis protocols, a more efficient passive collection strategy is feasible; for example, guano could be collected on tarps placed near the roost entrance. Such passive collection methods would greatly reduce the cost of sample collection by allowing more sites or roosts to be surveyed with a fraction of trained personnel, time, and effort investments needed.},

abstract={Generally speaking, fish intestinal microbiota is easily affected by food or water environment, and it may be dynamically changed along with body growth. However, it remains unclear whether fish gut microbiota can be affected under any conditions. In the present study, we focused on cultured larval turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and tracked its artificial breeding process from eggs to larvae in two farms located in different regions of China. Through continuous sampling, we analyzed and compared characteristics of intestinal microbiota in turbot larvae and its correlation with the bacteria in water and food at different developmental stages. The results showed that there was a steady group of microbiota in larval gut, and the highest relative abundance of strain was same between the two farms. This microbiota was established soon after hatching of fertilized eggs. Particularly, the structure of this microbiota was nearly not changeable afterward 3-4 months of development. The bacteria carried by fertilized eggs might play an important role during the formation of this microbiota. In conclusion, our findings suggested that there was a core microbiota represented by Lactococcus sp. in gut of artificially bred turbot larvae. The relative proportion of such strain in gut was higher than 30% at the initial stage of turbot life.},

abstract={The transferred microbiota from mother to baby constitutes the initial infant gastrointestinal microbiota and has an important influence on the development and health of infants in human. However, the reproductive tract microbiota of avian species and its inheritance have rarely been studied. We aimed to characterize the microbial community in the chicken reproductive tract and determine the origin of the chicken embryo gut microbiota. Microbiota in four different portions of chicken oviduct were determined using 16S rRNA metagenomic approach with the IonTorrent platform. Additionally, we analyzed the mother hen's magnum and cloaca, descendent egg, and embryo gut microbiota. The microbial composition and relative abundance of bacterial genera were stable throughout the entire chicken reproductive tract, without significant differences between the different parts of the oviduct. The chicken reproductive tract showed a relatively high abundance of Lactobacillus species. The number of bacterial species in the chicken reproductive tract significantly increased following sexual maturation. Core genera analysis detected 21 of common genera in the maternal magnum and cloaca, descendent egg shell, egg white, and embryo gut. Some elements of the maternal oviduct microbiota appear to be transferred to the embryo through the egg white and constitute most of the embryo gut bacterial population.},

abstract={Understanding the role of microbiota as reproductive barriers or sources of adaptive novelty in the fundamental biological phenomenon of speciation is an exciting new challenge necessitating exploration of microbiota variation in wild interbreeding species. We focused on two interbreeding cyprinid species, Chondrostoma nasus and Parachondrostoma toxostoma, which have geographic distributions characterized by a mosaic of hybrid zones. We described microbiota diversity and composition in the three main teleost mucosal tissues, the skin, gills and gut, in the parental parapatric populations. We found that tissue type was the principal determinant of bacterial community composition. In particular, there was strong microbiota differentiation between external and internal tissues, with secondary discrimination between the two species. These findings suggest that specific environmental and genetic filters associated with each species have shaped the bacterial communities, potentially reflecting deterministic assemblages of bacteria. We defined the core microbiota common to both Chondrostoma species for each tissue, highlighting the occurrence of microbe-host genome interactions at this critical level for studies of the functional consequences of hybridization. Further investigations will explore to what extend these specific tissue-associated microbiota signatures could be profoundly altered in hybrids, with functional consequences for post-mating reproductive isolation in relation to environmental constraints.},
