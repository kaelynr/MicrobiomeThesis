abstract={In this study, a novel type of mesophilic anaerobic bioreactor-an expanded granular sludge bed (EGSB)-was utilized to explore the effect of suspending reactor operation on the treatment performance and the microbial community structure. The parameters of performance and bacterial community before and after a four-week suspension were compared for the starch processing wastewater treatment bioreactor. The results indicate that the removal rate of the organic matter remained higher than 90%, although the biomass significantly decreased after restarting the reactor. However, the relatively stable microbial community structure before the suspension was altered significantly during the restart and post-running stages. This change was primarily due to variability in satellite species and the substitution effect of different dominant bacteria. For example, some non-major carbohydrate-degrading bacteria that were sensitive to nutrition deficiency, such as Desulfovibrio and Geobacter, were dramatically reduced after the suspension. In contrast, the stress of starvation stimulated the reproduction of hydrolytic bacteria, such as Macellibacteroides. However, the high bacterial diversity index (6.12-6.65) and the longstanding core species, including Chloroflexi, Cloacimonetes, Ignavibacteriae, Thermotogae and Euryarchaeota, maintained the functional stability of the reactor. Consequently, although the total bacteria decreased significantly after reactor operation was suspended, sufficient functional bacteria supported by the high diversity, as well as the longstanding core species, guaranteed the effective degradation after suspension.},

abstract={Here, we assessed the relative influence of wheat genotype, agricultural practices (conventional vs organic) and soil type on the rhizosphere microbiome. We characterized the prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi and protists) communities in soils from four different countries (Cameroon, France, Italy, Senegal) and determined if a rhizosphere core microbiome existed across these different countries. The wheat genotype had a limited effect on the rhizosphere microbiome (2% of variance) as the majority of the microbial taxa were consistently associated to multiple wheat genotypes grown in the same soil. Large differences in taxa richness and in community structure were observed between the eight soils studied (57% variance) and the two agricultural practices (10% variance). Despite these differences between soils, we observed that 177 taxa (2 archaea, 103 bacteria, 41 fungi and 31 protists) were consistently detected in the rhizosphere, constituting a core microbiome. In addition to being prevalent, these core taxa were highly abundant and collectively represented 50% of the reads in our data set. Based on these results, we identify a list of key taxa as future targets of culturomics, metagenomics and wheat synthetic microbiomes. Additionally, we show that protists are an integral part of the wheat holobiont that is currently overlooked.},

abstract={In this study, we aimed to investigate the ileum digesta of a large cohort of Japanese quail fed the same diet, with similar environmental conditions. We also address how P utilization (PU), Ca utilization (CaU), and bird performance (feed intake (FI), feed conversion (FC), and body weight gain (BWG)) modify intestinal microbiota of male and female quail. Despite the great number of samples analyzed (760), a core microbiome was composed of five bacteria. The Unc. Lactobacillus, Unc. Clostridaceae 1, Clostridium sensu stricto, Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus alactolyticus were detected in all samples and contributed to more than 70% of the total community. Depending on the bird predisposition for PU, CaU, FI, BWG, and FC, those species were present in higher or lower abundances. There was a significant gender effect on the ileal microbial community. While females had higher abundances of Lactobacillus, males were more colonized by Streptococcus alactolyticus. The entire cohort was highly colonized by Escherichia coli (8%-15%), an enteropathogenic bacteria. It remains unclear, if microbiota composition followed the mechanisms that caused different PU, CaU, FI, FC, and BWG or if the change in microbiota composition and function caused the differences in PU, CaU, and performance traits.},

abstract={Microbiome disruptions triggering disease outbreaks are increasingly threatening corals worldwide. In the Tropical Eastern Pacific, a necrotic-patch disease affecting gorgonian corals (sea fans, Pacifigorgia spp.) has been observed in recent years. However, the composition of the microbiome and its disease-related disruptions remain unknown in these gorgonian corals. Therefore, we analysed 16S rRNA gene amplicons from tissues of healthy colonies (n = 19) and from symptomatic-asymptomatic tissues of diseased colonies (n = 19) of Pacifigorgia cairnsi (Gorgoniidae: Octocorallia) in order to test for disease-related changes in the bacterial microbiome. We found that potential endosymbionts (mostly Endozoicomonas spp.) dominate the core microbiome in healthy colonies. Moreover, healthy tissues differed in community composition and functional profile from those of the symptomatic tissues but did not show differences to asymptomatic tissues of the diseased colonies. A more diverse set of bacteria was observed in symptomatic tissues, together with the decline in abundance of the potential endosymbionts from the healthy core microbiome. Furthermore, according to a comparative taxonomy-based functional profiling, these symptomatic tissues were characterized by the increase in heterotrophic, ammonia oxidizer and dehalogenating bacteria and by the depletion of nitrite and sulphate reducers. Overall, our results suggest that the bacterial microbiome associated with the disease behaves opportunistically and is likely in a state of microbial dysbiosis. We also conclude that the confinement of the disease-related consortium to symptomatic tissues may facilitate colony recovery.},

abstract={We sought to compare the vaginal microbiota profiles of Taiwanese women with severe preeclampsia (SPE) and normotensive control pregnancies. In a discovery cohort, vaginal swab samples and paired blood specimens were simultaneously obtained at the time of caesarean delivery from 30 women with SPE and 30 controls. The composition of vaginal microbiota was characterised by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region. Results were subsequently validated by real-time qPCR. We sought confirmation of our findings in an expanded cohort consisting of 58 women with SPE and 55 controls. In both the discovery and confirmation cohorts, women with SPE had higher relative abundance of Prevotella bivia in their vaginal microbial community (P = 0.006 and 0.011, respectively). Plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were higher when compared with controls (P = 0.031) in the confirmation cohort. Three variables (vaginal Prevotella bivia, plasma TNF-alpha, and body mass index [BMI]) were included in a prediction panel for SPE. Of these, BMI was the most predictive variable. The area under the curve (AUC) of predicted probability values for the three-variable panel revealed that it can discriminate between SPE and normotensive pregnancies with good accuracy (AUC = 0.797, P < 0.001). We conclude that enrichment of Prevotella bivia in vaginal microbiota, which is tightly regulated by BMI, may be involved in the pathogenesis of SPE.},
