abstract={The community of microorganisms in the gut is affected by host species, diet and environment and is linked to normal functioning of the host organism. Although the microbiome fluctuates in response to host demands and environmental changes, there are core groups of microorganisms that remain relatively constant throughout the hosts lifetime. Ruminants are mammals that rely on highly specialized digestive and metabolic modifications, including microbiome adaptations, to persist in extreme environments. Here, we assayed the fecal microbiome of four mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in western North America. We quantified fecal microbiome diversity and composition among groups in the wild and captivity, across populations and in a single group over time. There were no differences in community evenness or diversity across groups, although we observed a decreasing diversity trend across summer months. Pairwise sample estimates grouped the captive population distinctly from the wild populations, and moderately grouped the southern wild group distinctly from the two northern wild populations. We identified 33 genera modified by captivity, with major differences in key groups associated with cellulose degradation that likely reflect differences in diet. Our findings are consistent with other ruminant studies and provide baseline microbiome data in this enigmatic species, offering valuable insights into the health of wild alpine ungulates.},

abstract={Humans are ecosystems containing trillions of microorganisms, but the evolutionary history of this microbiome is obscured by a lack of knowledge about microbiomes of African apes. We sequenced the gut communities of hundreds of chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas and developed a phylogenetic approach to reconstruct how present-day human microbiomes have diverged from those of ancestral populations. Compositional change in the microbiome was slow and clock-like during African ape diversification, but human microbiomes have deviated from the ancestral state at an accelerated rate. Relative to the microbiomes of wild apes, human microbiomes have lost ancestral microbial diversity while becoming specialized for animal-based diets. Individual wild apes cultivate more phyla, classes, orders, families, genera, and species of bacteria than do individual humans across a range of societies. These results indicate that humanity has experienced a depletion of the gut flora since diverging from Pan.},

abstract={The gut microbiota plays a key role in the nutritional ecology of ruminants, and host diet has a significant effect on these microbial communities. Longitudinal studies assessing variation of seasonal microbiota in animals can provide a comparative context for interpreting the adaptive significance of such changes. However, few studies have investigated the effects of seasonally-related dietary shifts on the gut microbial communities of endangered forest musk deer (FMD), and the national breeding programs need this information to promote the growth of captive populations. The present study applied bacterial 16S rRNA genes based on high-throughput sequencing to profile the fecal microbial communities of FMD across four seasons. Microbial diversity was higher in seasons with dry leaf diets (winter and spring) compared to seasons with fresh leaf diets (summer and autumn). The dominant microbial phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and the core bacterial taxa also comprised mostly (94.40% of shared OTUs) Firmicutes (37 taxa) and Bacteroidetes (6 taxa), which were relatively stable across different seasons. The Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratio declined in seasons with fresh leaf diets relative to seasons with dry leaf diets, and the dominant genera among the four seasons showed no significant variation in abundance. This work explores the seasonal variation in the microbial communities of FMD for the first time, and reveals how gut microbial community dynamics vary seasonally in accordance with differences in dietary plants (fresh and dry leaf). These results indicate that the annual cyclic reconfiguration of FMD gut microbiota could be associated with shifts in dietary nutrients, which is important information to inform captive FMD management.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Resident soil microbiota play key roles in sustaining the core ecosystem processes of terrestrial Antarctica, often involving unique taxa with novel functional traits. However, the full scope of biodiversity and the niche-neutral processes underlying these communities remain unclear. In this study, we combine multivariate analyses, co-occurrence networks and fitted species abundance distributions on an extensive set of bacterial, micro-eukaryote and archaeal amplicon sequencing data to unravel soil microbiome patterns of nine sites across two east Antarctic regions, the Vestfold Hills and Windmill Islands. To our knowledge, this is the first microbial biodiversity report on the hyperarid Vestfold Hills soil environment. RESULTS: Our findings reveal distinct regional differences in phylogenetic composition, abundance and richness amongst microbial taxa. Actinobacteria dominated soils in both regions, yet Bacteroidetes were more abundant in the Vestfold Hills compared to the Windmill Islands, which contained a high abundance of novel phyla. However, intra-region comparisons demonstrate greater homogeneity of soil microbial communities and measured environmental parameters between sites at the Vestfold Hills. Community richness is largely driven by a variable suite of parameters but robust associations between co-existing members highlight potential interactions and sharing of niche space by diverse taxa from all three microbial domains of life examined. Overall, non-neutral processes appear to structure the polar soil microbiomes studied here, with niche partitioning being particularly strong for bacterial communities at the Windmill Islands. Eukaryotic and archaeal communities reveal weaker niche-driven signatures accompanied by multimodality, suggesting the emergence of neutrality. CONCLUSION: We provide new information on assemblage patterns, environmental drivers and non-random occurrences for Antarctic soil microbiomes, particularly the Vestfold Hills, where basic diversity, ecology and life history strategies of resident microbiota are largely unknown. Greater understanding of these basic ecological concepts is a pivotal step towards effective conservation management.},

abstract={Given the ecological significance of microorganisms in algal blooming events, it is critical to understand the mechanisms regarding their distribution under different conditions. We tested the hypothesis that microbial community succession is strongly associated with algal bloom stages, and that the assembly mechanisms are cocontrolled by deterministic and stochastic processes. Community structures and underlying ecological processes of microbial populations (attached and free-living bacteria) at three algal bloom stages (pre-, during, and postbloom) over a complete dinoflagellate Scrippsiella trochoidea bloom were investigated. Both attached and free-living taxa had a strong response to the bloom event, and the latter was more sensitive than the former. The contribution of environmental parameters to microbial variability was 40.2%. Interaction analysis showed that complex positive or negative correlation networks exist in phycosphere microbes. These relationships were the potential drivers of mutualist and competitive interactions that impacted bacterial succession. Null model analysis showed that the attached bacterial community primarily exhibited deterministic processes at pre- and during-bloom stages, while dispersal-related processes contributed to a greater extent at the postbloom stage. In the free-living bacterial community, homogeneous selection and dispersal limitation dominated in the initial phase, which gave way to more deterministic processes at the two later stages. Relative contribution analyses further demonstrated that the community turnover of attached bacteria was mainly driven by environmental selection, while stochastic factors had partial effects on the assembly of free-living bacteria. Taken together, these data demonstrated that a robust link exists between bacterioplankton community structure and bloom progression, and phycosphere microbial succession trajectories are cogoverned by both deterministic and random processes.IMPORTANCE Disentangling the mechanisms shaping bacterioplankton communities during a marine ecological event is a core concern for ecologists. Harmful algal bloom (HAB) is a typical ecological disaster, and its formation is significantly influenced by alga-bacterium interactions. Microbial community shifts during the HAB process are relatively well known. However, the assembly processes of microbial communities in an HAB are not fully understood, especially the relative influences of deterministic and stochastic processes. We therefore analyzed the relative contributions of deterministic and stochastic processes during an HAB event. Both free-living and attached bacterial groups had a dramatic response to the HAB, and the relative importance of determinism versus stochasticity varied between the two bacterial groups at various bloom stages. Environmental factors and biotic interactions were the main drivers impacting the microbial shift process. Our results strengthen the understanding of the ecological mechanisms controlling microbial community patterns during the HAB process.},
