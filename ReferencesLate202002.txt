AB  - Pharmaceuticals are micropollutants often present in wastewater treatment
      systems. In this study, the potential impact of such micropollutants on the
      bacterial population within aerobic granular sludge (AGS) bioreactor was
      investigated. The AGS bacterial community structure and composition were accessed
      combining DGGE fingerprinting and barcoded pyrosequencing analysis. Both revealed
      the existence of a dynamic bacterial community, independently of the
      pharmaceuticals presence. The AGS microbiome at both phylum and class levels
      varied over time and, after stopping pharmaceuticals feeding, the bacterial
      community did not return to its initial composition. Nevertheless, most of the
      assigned OTUs were present throughout the different operational phases. This core
      microbiome, represented by over 72% of the total sequences in each phase,
      probably played an important role in biological removal processes, avoiding their
      failure during the disturbance period. Quantitative-PCR revealed that
      pharmaceuticals load led to gradual changes on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing
      bacteria (AOB), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and polyphosphate-accumulating
      organisms (PAO) but their persistence during that phase demonstrated the
      resilience of such bacterial groups. AGS microbiome changed over time but a core 
      community was maintained, probably ensuring the accomplishment of the main
      biological removal processes.

AB  - Understanding the role of microbiota as reproductive barriers or sources of
      adaptive novelty in the fundamental biological phenomenon of speciation is an
      exciting new challenge necessitating exploration of microbiota variation in wild 
      interbreeding species. We focused on two interbreeding cyprinid species,
      Chondrostoma nasus and Parachondrostoma toxostoma, which have geographic
      distributions characterized by a mosaic of hybrid zones. We described microbiota 
      diversity and composition in the three main teleost mucosal tissues, the skin,
      gills and gut, in the parental parapatric populations. We found that tissue type 
      was the principal determinant of bacterial community composition. In particular, 
      there was strong microbiota differentiation between external and internal
      tissues, with secondary discrimination between the two species. These findings
      suggest that specific environmental and genetic filters associated with each
      species have shaped the bacterial communities, potentially reflecting
      deterministic assemblages of bacteria. We defined the core microbiota common to
      both Chondrostoma species for each tissue, highlighting the occurrence of
      microbe-host genome interactions at this critical level for studies of the
      functional consequences of hybridization. Further investigations will explore to 
      what extend these specific tissue-associated microbiota signatures could be
      profoundly altered in hybrids, with functional consequences for post-mating
      reproductive isolation in relation to environmental constraints.

TI  - Development of a Stable Lung Microbiome in Healthy Neonatal Mice.
PG  - 529-542
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1068-x [doi]
AB  - The lower respiratory tract has been previously considered sterile in a healthy
      state, but advances in culture-independent techniques for microbial
      identification and characterization have revealed that the lung harbors a diverse
      microbiome. Although research on the lung microbiome is increasing and important 
      questions were already addressed, longitudinal studies aiming to describe
      developmental stages of the microbial communities from the early neonatal period 
      to adulthood are lacking. Thus, little is known about the early-life development 
      of the lung microbiome and the impact of external factors during these stages. In
      this study, we applied a barcoding approach based on high-throughput sequencing
      of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon libraries to determine age-dependent
      differences in the bacterial fraction of the murine lung microbiome and to assess
      potential influences of differing "environmental microbiomes" (simulated by the
      application of used litter material to the cages). We could clearly show that the
      diversity of the bacterial community harbored in the murine lung increases with
      age. Interestingly, bacteria belonging to the genera Delftia and Rhodococcus
      formed an age-independent core microbiome. The addition of the used litter
      material influenced the lung microbiota of young mice but did not significantly
      alter the community composition of adult animals. Our findings elucidate the
      dynamic nature of the early-life lung microbiota and its stabilization with age. 
      Further, this study indicates that even slight environmental changes modulate the
      bacterial community composition of the lung microbiome in early life, whereas the
      lung microbes of adults demonstrate higher resilience towards environmental
      variations.

TI  - The Gut Microbiome and Mental Health: Implications for Anxiety- and
      Trauma-Related Disorders.
PG  - 90-107
LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0077 [doi]
AB  - Biological psychiatry research has long focused on the brain in elucidating the
      neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. This review 
      challenges this assumption and suggests that the gut microbiome and its
      interactome also deserve attention to understand brain disorders and develop
      innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth
      characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health
      and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the gut microbiome in
      anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis sits
      at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an
      important role in the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
      axis early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we 
      highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in psychiatric disorders,
      focusing on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders specifically, and discuss the
      gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled
      researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals.
      The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics,
      metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the
      present review. Other factors that shape the gut microbiome should be considered 
      to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome
      linked to the MGB. In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science,
      and gut microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in mental illness 
      and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and 
      postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it
      plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health
      research in the next decade.

      Corallium rubrum Across the Mediterranean Sea.
PG  - 274-288
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1006-y [doi]
AB  - Populations of key benthic habitat-forming octocoral species have declined
      significantly in the Mediterranean Sea due to mass mortality events caused by
      microbial disease outbreaks linked to high summer seawater temperatures.
      Recently, we showed that the microbial communities of these octocorals are
      relatively structured; however, our knowledge on the seasonal dynamics of these
      microbiomes is still limited. To investigate their seasonal stability, we
      collected four soft gorgonian species (Eunicella singularis, Eunicella cavolini, 
      Eunicella verrucosa and Leptogorgia sarmentosa) and the precious red coral
      (Corallium rubrum) from two coastal locations with different terrestrial impact
      levels in the Mediterranean Sea, and used next-generation amplicon sequencing of 
      the 16S rRNA gene. The microbiomes of all soft gorgonian species were dominated
      by the same 'core microbiome' bacteria belonging to the Endozoicomonas and the
      Cellvibrionales clade BD1-7, whereas the red coral microbiome was primarily
      composed of 'core' Spirochaetes, Oceanospirillales ME2 and Parcubacteria. The
      associations with these bacterial taxa were relatively consistent over time at
      each location for each octocoral species. However, differences in microbiome
      composition and seasonal dynamics were observed between locations and could
      primarily be attributed to locally variant bacteria. Overall, our data provide
      further evidence of the intricate symbiotic relationships that exist between
      Mediterranean octocorals and their associated microbes, which are ancient and
      highly conserved over both space and time, and suggest regulation of the
      microbiome composition by the host, depending on local conditions.

TI  - Gut microbial communities of American pikas (Ochotona princeps): Evidence for
      phylosymbiosis and adaptations to novel diets.

AB  - Gut microbial communities provide many physiological functions to their hosts,
      especially in herbivorous animals. We still lack an understanding of how these
      microbial communities are structured across hosts in nature, especially within a 
      given host species. Studies on laboratory mice have demonstrated that host
      genetics can influence microbial community structure, but that diet can overwhelm
      these genetic effects. We aimed to test these ideas in a natural system, the
      American pika (Ochotona princeps). First, pikas are high-elevation specialists
      with significant population structure across various mountain ranges in the USA, 
      allowing us to investigate whether similarities in microbial communities match
      host genetic differences. Additionally, pikas are herbivorous, with some
      populations exhibiting remarkable dietary plasticity and consuming high levels of
      moss, which is exceptionally high in fibre and low in protein. This allows us to 
      investigate adaptations to an herbivorous diet, as well as to the especially
      challenging diet of moss. Here, we inventoried the microbial communities of pika 
      caecal pellets from various populations using 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate 
      structuring of microbial communities across various populations with different
      natural diets. Microbial communities varied significantly across populations, and
      differences in microbial community structure were congruent with genetic
      differences in host population structure, a pattern known as "phylosymbiosis."
      Several microbial members (Ruminococcus, Prevotella, Oxalobacter and Coprococcus)
      were detected across all samples, and thus likely represent a "core microbiome." 
      These genera are known to perform a number of services for herbivorous hosts such
      as fibre fermentation and the degradation of plant defensive compounds, and thus 
      are likely important for herbivory in pikas. Moreover, pikas that feed on moss
      harboured microbial communities highly enriched in Melainabacteria. This
      uncultivable candidate phylum has been proposed to ferment fibre for herbivores, 
      and thus may contribute to the ability of some pika populations to consume high
      amounts of moss. These findings demonstrate that both host genetics and diet can 
      influence the microbial communities of the American pika. These animals may be
      novel sources of fibre-degrading microbes. Last, we discuss the implications of
      population-specific microbial communities for conservation efforts in this
      species.
