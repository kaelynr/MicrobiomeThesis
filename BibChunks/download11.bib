abstract={Projected population growth and climate change will make it inevitable to convert neglected and marginal land into productive arable land. We investigate the influence of agricultural management practices on nutrient stocks and soil functions during the conversion of former extensively used grassland to arable land. Effects of grassland removal, tillage, intercropping with faba bean (Vicia faba) and its later incorporation were studied with respect to soil properties and bacterial community structure. Therefore, composite samples were collected with a core sampler from the topsoil (0-20 cm) in (a) the initial grassland, (b) the transitional phase during the vegetation period of V. faba, (c) after ploughing the legume in, and (d) untreated controls. In all samples, nitrate-N, ammonium-N, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen bound (TNb) were analyzed and comparisons of the bacterial community structure after 16S-amplicon sequencing were performed to assess soil functions. Mineralization after grassland conversion followed by the biological nitrogen fixation of broad beans enhanced the nitrate-N content in bulk soil from 4 to almost 50 mug N g(-)(1)dw. Bacterial community structure on phylum level in bulk soil was dominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes and remained almost stable. However, alpha and beta-diversity analysis revealed a change of the bacterial composition at the final state of the conversion. This change was primarily driven by increasing abundances of the genera Massilia and Lysobacter, both members of the Proteobacteria, after the decay of the leguminous plant residues. Furthermore, increasing abundances of the family Gaiellaceae and its genus Gaiella fostered this change and were related to the decreasing carbon to nitrogen ratio. In short, gentle management strategies could replace the input of mineral fertilizer with the aim to contribute to future sustainable and intensified production even on converted grassland.},

abstract={We explore the microbiota of 18 body sites in over 200 individuals using sequences amplified V1-V3 and the V3-V5 small subunit ribosomal RNA (16S) hypervariable regions as part of the NIH Common Fund Human Microbiome Project. The body sites with the greatest number of core OTUs, defined as OTUs shared amongst 95% or more of the individuals, were the oral sites (saliva, tongue, cheek, gums, and throat) followed by the nose, stool, and skin, while the vaginal sites had the fewest number of OTUs shared across subjects. We found that commonalities between samples based on taxonomy could sometimes belie variability at the sub-genus OTU level. This was particularly apparent in the mouth where a given genus can be present in many different oral sites, but the sub-genus OTUs show very distinct site selection, and in the vaginal sites, which are consistently dominated by the Lactobacillus genus but have distinctly different sub-genus V1-V3 OTU populations across subjects. Different body sites show approximately a ten-fold difference in estimated microbial richness, with stool samples having the highest estimated richness, followed by the mouth, throat and gums, then by the skin, nasal and vaginal sites. Richness as measured by the V1-V3 primers was consistently higher than richness measured by V3-V5. We also show that when such a large cohort is analyzed at the genus level, most subjects fit the stool "enterotype" profile, but other subjects are intermediate, blurring the distinction between the enterotypes. When analyzed at the finer-scale, OTU level, there was little or no segregation into stool enterotypes, but in the vagina distinct biotypes were apparent. Finally, we note that even OTUs present in nearly every subject, or that dominate in some samples, showed orders of magnitude variation in relative abundance emphasizing the highly variable nature across individuals.},

abstract={The North American prairie covered about 3.6 million-km(2) of the continent prior to European contact. Only 1-2% of the original prairie remains, but the soils that developed under these prairies are some of the most productive and fertile in the world, containing over 35% of the soil carbon in the continental United States. Cultivation may alter microbial diversity and composition, influencing the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements. Here, we explored the structure and functional potential of the soil microbiome in paired cultivated-corn (at the time of sampling) and never-cultivated native prairie soils across a three-states transect (Wisconsin, Iowa, and Kansas) using metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and lipid analysis. At the Wisconsin site, we also sampled adjacent restored prairie and switchgrass plots. We found that agricultural practices drove differences in community composition and diversity across the transect. Microbial biomass in prairie samples was twice that of cultivated soils, but alpha diversity was higher with cultivation. Metagenome analyses revealed denitrification and starch degradation genes were abundant across all soils, as were core genes involved in response to osmotic stress, resource transport, and environmental sensing. Together, these data indicate that cultivation shifted the microbiome in consistent ways across different regions of the prairie, but also suggest that many functions are resilient to changes caused by land management practices - perhaps reflecting adaptations to conditions common to tallgrass prairie soils in the region (e.g., soil type, parent material, development under grasses, temperature and rainfall patterns, and annual freeze-thaw cycles). These findings are important for understanding the long-term consequences of land management practices to prairie soil microbial communities and their genetic potential to carry out key functions.},

abstract={Estrogen decline during menopause is associated with altered metabolism, weight gain and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. The gut microbiota also plays a role in the development of cardiometabolic dysfunction and is also subject to changes associated with age-related hormone changes. Phytoestrogens are plant-based estrogen mimics that have gained popularity as dietary supplements for the treatment or prevention of menopause-related symptoms. These compounds have the potential to both modulate and be metabolized by the gut microbiota. Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) contain potent phytoestrogen precursors, which rely on microbial biotransformation in the gut to estrogenic forms. We supplemented ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated (SHAM) C57BL/6 mice, with oral estradiol (E2), a flavonoid-rich extract from hops, or a placebo carrier oil, to observe effects on adiposity, inflammation, and gut bacteria composition. Hops extract (HE) and E2 protected against increased visceral adiposity and liver triglyceride accumulation in OVX animals. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of OVX having a significant impact on the overall gut bacterial community structure. We did find differences in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, which was lower with HE treatment in the SHAM group relative to OVX E2 treatment and to placebo in the SHAM group.},

abstract={With the continual improvement in high-throughput sequencing technology and constant updates to fungal reference databases, the use of amplicon-based DNA markers as a tool to reveal fungal diversity and composition in various ecosystems has become feasible. However, both primer selection and the experimental procedure require meticulous verification. Here, we computationally and experimentally evaluated the accuracy and specificity of three widely used or newly designed internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primer sets (ITS1F/ITS2, gITS7/ITS4 and 5.8S-Fun/ITS4-Fun). In silico evaluation revealed that primer coverage varied at different taxonomic levels due to differences in degeneracy and the location of primer sets. Using even and staggered mock community standards, we identified different proportions of chimeric and mismatch reads generated by different primer sets, as well as great variation in species abundances, suggesting that primer selection would affect the results of amplicon-based metabarcoding studies. Choosing proofreading and high-fidelity polymerase (KAPA HiFi) could significantly reduce the percentage of chimeric and mismatch sequences, further reducing inflation of operational taxonomic units. Moreover, for two types of environmental fungal communities, plant endophytic and soil fungi, it was demonstrated that the three primer sets could not reach a consensus on fungal community composition or diversity, and that primer selection, not experimental treatment, determines observed soil fungal community diversity and composition. Future DNA marker surveys should pay greater attention to potential primer effects and improve the experimental scheme to increase credibility and accuracy.},
