abstract={Our understanding of human microbial communities, in particular in regard to diseases is advancing, yet the basic understanding of the microbiome in healthy subjects over time remains limited. The oropharynx is a key target for colonization by several important human pathogens. To understand how the oropharyngeal microbiome might limit infections, and how intercurrent infections might be associated with its composition, we characterized the oropharyngeal microbiome of 18 healthy adults, sampled weekly over a 40-weeks using culture-independent molecular techniques. We detected nine phyla, 202 genera and 1438 assignments on OTU level, dominated by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria on phylum level. Individual microbiomes of participants were characterized by levels of high alpha diversity (mean = 204.55 OTUs, sd = 35.64), evenness (19.83, sd = 9.74) and high temporal stability (mean Pearson's correlation between samples of 0.52, sd = 0.060), with greater differences in microbiome community composition between than within individuals. Significant changes in community composition were associated with disease states, suggesting that it is possible to detect specific changes in OTU abundance and community composition during illness. We defined the common core microbiota by varying occurrence and abundance thresholds showing that individual core microbiomes share a substantial number of OTUs across participants, chiefly Streptococci and Veillonella. Our results provide insights into the microbial communities that characterize the healthy human oropharynx, community structure and variability, and provide new approaches to define individual and shared cores. The wider implications of this result include the potential for modeling the general dynamics of oropharynx microbiota both in health and in response to antimicrobial treatments or probiotics.},

abstract={The endophytic microbiota can establish mutualistic or commensalistic interactions within the host plant tissues. We investigated the bacterial endophytic microbiota in three species of Mediterranean orchids (Neottia ovata, Serapias vomeracea, and Spiranthes spiralis) by metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA gene. We examined whether the different orchid species and organs, both underground and aboveground, influenced the endophytic bacterial communities. A total of 1,930 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained, mainly Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, whose distribution model indicated that the plant organ was the main determinant of the bacterial community structure. The co-occurrence network was not modular, suggesting a relative homogeneity of the microbiota between both plant species and organs. Moreover, the decrease in species richness and diversity in the aerial vegetative organs may indicate a filtering effect by the host plant. We identified four hub OTUs, three of them already reported as plant-associated taxa (Pseudoxanthomonas, Rhizobium, and Mitsuaria), whereas Thermus was an unusual member of the plant microbiota. Core microbiota analysis revealed a selective and systemic ascent of bacterial communities from the vegetative to the reproductive organs. The core microbiota was also maintained in the S. spiralis seeds, suggesting a potential vertical transfer of the microbiota. Surprisingly, some S. spiralis seed samples displayed a very rich endophytic microbiota, with a large number of OTUs shared with the roots, a situation that may lead to a putative restoring process of the root-associated microbiota in the progeny. Our results indicate that the bacterial community has adapted to colonize the orchid organs selectively and systemically, suggesting an active involvement in the orchid holobiont.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Equine gut microbiology studies to date have primarily focused on horses and ponies, which represent only one of the eight extant equine species. This is despite asses and mules comprising almost half of the world's domesticated equines, and donkeys being superior to horses/ponies in their ability to degrade dietary fiber. Limited attention has also been given to commensal anaerobic fungi and archaea even though anaerobic fungi are potent fiber degrading organisms, the activity of which is enhanced by methanogenic archaea. Therefore, the objective of this study was to broaden the current knowledge of bacterial, anaerobic fungal and archaeal diversity of the equine fecal microbiota to multiple species of equines. Core taxa shared by all the equine fecal samples (n = 70) were determined and an overview given of the microbiota across different equine types (horse, donkey, horse x donkey and zebra). RESULTS: Equine type was associated with differences in both fecal microbial concentrations and community composition. Donkey was generally most distinct from the other equine types, with horse and zebra not differing. Despite this, a common bacterial core of eight OTUs (out of 2070) and 16 genus level groupings (out of 231) was found in all the fecal samples. This bacterial core represented a much larger proportion of the equine fecal microbiota than previously reported, primarily due to the detection of predominant core taxa belonging to the phyla Kiritimatiellaeota (formerly Verrucomicrobia subdivision 5) and Spirochaetes. The majority of the core bacterial taxa lack cultured representation. Archaea and anaerobic fungi were present in all animals, however, no core taxon was detected for either despite several taxa being prevalent and predominant. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst differences were observed between equine types, a core fecal microbiota existed across all the equines. This core was composed primarily of a few predominant bacterial taxa, the majority of which are novel and lack cultured representation. The lack of microbial cultures representing the predominant taxa needs to be addressed, as their availability is essential to gain fundamental knowledge of the microbial functions that underpin the equine hindgut ecosystem.},

abstract={This study aimed to explore the dynamics of microbial communities and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during biofilm formation on polypropylene random (PPR), polyvinyl chloride and stainless steel pipes in domestic hot water system (DHWS), as well as their interactions. Full-scale classification was used to divide abundant and rare genera with 0.1% and 1% as the thresholds. The biofilm community structure presented a temporal pattern, which was mainly determined by conditionally rare or abundant taxa (CRAT) and conditionally rare taxa (CRT). The dynamics of microbial community during biofilm formation were observed, and the effect of pipe material on conditionally abundant taxa (CAT) and CRAT was greater than CRT and rare taxa (RT). CRAT showed the most complex internal associations and were identified as the core taxa. Notably, CRT and RT with low relative abundance, also played an important role in the network. For potential pathogens, 17 genera were identified in this study, and their total relative abundance was the highest (3.6-28.9%) in PPR samples. Enterococcus of CRAT was the dominant potential pathogen in young biofilms. There were 36 more co-exclusion patterns (140) observed between potential pathogens and nonpathogenic bacteria than co-occurrence (104). A total of 38 ARGs were predicted, and 109 negative and 165 positive correlations were detected between them. Some potential pathogens (Escherichia/Shigella and Burkholderia) and nonpathogenic bacteria (Meiothermus and Sphingopyxis) were identified as the possible hosts of ARGs. This study is helpful for a comprehensive understanding of the biofilm microbial community and ARGs, and provides a reference for the management and biosafety guarantee of newly-built DHWS.},

abstract={Peri-implantitis and periodontitis are both polymicrobial diseases induced by subgingival plaque accumulation, with some differing clinical features. Studies on the microbial and gene transcription activity of peri-implantitis microbiota are limited. This study aimed to verify the hypothesis that disease-specific microbial and gene transcription activity lead to disease-specific clinical features, using an integrated metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and network analysis. Metagenomic data in peri-implantitis and periodontitis were obtained from the same 21 subjects and metatranscriptomic data from 12 subjects were obtained from a database. The microbial co-occurrence network based on metagenomic analysis had more diverse species taxa and correlations than the network based on the metatranscriptomic analysis. Solobacterium moorei and Prevotella denticola had high activity and were core species taxa specific to peri-implantitis in the co-occurrence network. Moreover, the activity of plasmin receptor/glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes was higher in peri-implantitis. These activity differences may increase complexity in the peri-implantitis microbiome and distinguish clinical symptoms of the two diseases. These findings should help in exploring a novel biomarker that assist in the diagnosis and preventive treatment design of peri-implantitis.},

abstract={Heavy metal(loid)s exert selective pressure on microbial communities and evolution of metal resistance determinants. Despite increasing knowledge concerning the impact of metal pollution on microbial community and ecological function, it is still a challenge to identify a consistent pattern of microbial community composition along gradients of elevated metal(loid)s in natural environments. Further, our current knowledge of the microbial metal resistome at the community level has been lagging behind compared to the state-of-the-art genetic profiling of bacterial metal resistance mechanisms in a pure culture system. This review provides an overview of the core metal resistant microbiome, development of metal resistance strategies, and potential factors driving the diversity and distribution of metal resistance determinants in natural environments. The impacts of biotic factors regulating the bacterial metal resistome are highlighted. We finally discuss the advances in multiple technologies, research challenges, and future directions to better understand the interface of the environmental microbiome with the metal resistome. This review aims to highlight the diversity and wide distribution of heavy metal(loid)s and their corresponding resistance determinants, helping to better understand the resistance strategy at the community level.},

abstract={The objective of this experiment was to compare ruminal fluid samples collected through rumen cannula (RC) or using an oral stomach tube (ST) for measurement of ruminal fermentation and microbiota variables. Six ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows fed a standard diet were used in the study. Rumen samples were collected at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h after the morning feeding on two consecutive days using both RC and ST techniques. Samples were filtered through two layers of cheesecloth and the filtered ruminal fluid was used for further analysis. Compared with RC, ST samples had 7% greater pH; however, the pattern in pH change after feeding was similar between sampling methods. Total volatile fatty acids (VFA), acetate and propionate concentrations in ruminal fluid were on average 23% lower for ST compared with RC. There were no differences between RC and ST in VFA molar proportions (except for isobutyrate), ammonia and dissolved hydrogen (dH2) concentrations, or total protozoa counts, and there were no interactions between sampling technique and time of sampling. Bacterial ASV richness was higher in ST compared with RC samples; however, no differences were observed for Shannon diversity. Based on Permanova analysis, bacterial community composition was influenced by sampling method and there was an interaction between sampling method and time of sampling. A core microbiota comprised of Prevotella, S24-7, unclassified Bacteroidales and unclassified Clostridiales, Butyrivibrio, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, unclassified Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcus, and Sharpea was present in both ST and RC samples, although their relative abundance varied and was influenced by an interaction between sampling time and sampling method. Overall, our results suggest that ruminal fluid samples collected using ST (at 180 to 200 cm depth) are not representative of rumen pH, absolute values of VFA concentrations, or bacterial communities >2 h post-feeding when compared to samples of ruminal fluid collected using RC. However, ST can be a feasible sampling technique if the purpose is to study molar proportions of VFA, protozoa counts, dH2, and ammonia concentrations.},

abstract={In this study, one lab-scale EGSB reactor (1.47 L volume) was designed to treat the antibiotic wastewater under different environmental factors, including the addition of cephalexin (CFX), Temperature (T) and Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT). The microbial community structure in EGSB reactor was analyzed with high-throughput sequencing technology to investigate their response to environmental factors changes, and then the random-matrix-theory (RMT)-based network analysis was used to investigate the microbial community's molecular ecological network in EGSB systems treating antibiotics wastewater. Moreover, the explanatory value of each environmental factor on the change of microbial community structure was obtained through the result of redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that the addition of cephalexin (CFX), decline of T and decline of HRT (8 h) would decrease the removal efficiency of COD decreasing. And the removal efficiency of CFX would not be affected by decline of T and HRT, except the producing and degrading process of CFX by-products was changed obviously. The result of RDA analysis suggested the environmental factors mainly affected bacterial and fungal microbial community structure but not archaeal ones. The result of high-throughput sequencing showed the relative abundance (RA) of Firmicutes had been obviously affected by T and HRT, which might be main reason leading to the decrease of COD removal efficiency. In addition, molecular ecological network analysis showed the growth of Bacteroidetes occupied the niche of functional microorganism and led to the unstable operation of EGSB when T declined. What's more, the molecular ecological network analysis revealed that Exophiala which belonged to fungi Ascomycota phylum was the hub genus to degrade complex refractory organic pollutants, and Aceticlastic methanogens Methanosaeta was the core functional archaea genus.},

abstract={The bacterial community of the artisanal Adobera cheese from Los Altos de Jalisco was described through high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene libraries. Samples were collected in two different seasons (dry and rainy) during four key steps of the manufacturing process (raw milk, fresh curd, matured curd, and cheese). Bacterial diversity was higher in early steps in comparison with the final elaboration stages. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla, strongly represented by the Streptococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillaceae families, and core bacteria genera such as Streptococcus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Lactobacillus spp. Undesirable bacteria, including Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp., were also detected in raw milk but almost undetectable at the end of the cheese manufacturing process, and seemed to be displaced by lactic-acid bacteria-related genera. Seasonal effects were observed on the community structure but did not define the core microbiota composition. Predictive metabolism was related to membrane transport, and amino-acid, lipid, and carbohydrate metabolism pathways. Our results contribute to deduce the role of bacteria involved in Adobera cheese manufacturing in terms of the metabolism involved, cheese microbial safety, and how undesirable bacterial populations could be regulated by process standardization as a potential tool to improve safety.},

abstract={Gut microbes play an important role in the biology and evolution of insects. Australian native dung beetles (Scarabaeinae) present an opportunity to study gut microbiota in an evolutionary context as they come from two distinct phylogenetic lineages and some species in each lineage have secondarily adapted to alternative or broader diets. In this study, we characterised the hindgut bacterial communities found in 21 species of dung beetles across two lineages using 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that gut microbial diversity was more dependent on host phylogeny and gut morphology than specific dietary preferences or environment. In particular, gut microbial diversity was highest in the endemic, flightless genus Cephalodesmius that feeds on a broad range of composted organic matter. The hindgut of Cephalodesmius harbours a highly conserved core set of bacteria suggesting that the bacteria are symbiotic. Symbiosis is supported by the persistence of the core microbiota across isolated beetle populations and between species in the genus. A co-evolutionary relationship is supported by the expansion of the hindgut to form a fermentation chamber and the fermentative nature of the core microbes. In contrast, Australian species of the widespread dung beetle genus Onthophagus, specialise on a single food resource such as dung or fungus, exhibit minimal food processing behaviour, have a short, narrow hindgut and a variable gut microbiota with relatively few core bacterial taxa. A conserved, complex gut microbiota is hypothesised to be unnecessary for this highly mobile genus.IMPORTANCE Dung beetles are a very important part of an ecosystem because of their role in the removal and decomposition of vertebrate dung. It has been suspected that symbiotic gut bacteria facilitate this role, a hypothesis that we have explored with high throughput barcoding. We found that differences in hindgut morphology had the greatest effect on the bacterial community composition. Species with a hindgut fermentation chamber harboured a distinctly different hindgut community compared to those species with a narrow, undifferentiated hindgut. Diet and phylogeny were also associated with differences in gut community. Further understanding of the relationships between dung beetles and their gut microbes will provide insights into the evolution of their behaviours and how gut communities contribute to their fitness.},

abstract={The Amazon rainforest is the world's largest tropical forest, and this biome may be a significant contributor to primary biological aerosol (PBA) emissions on a global scale. These aerosols also play a pivotal role in modulating ecosystem dynamics, dispersing biological material over geographic barriers and influencing climate through radiation absorption, light scattering, or acting as cloud condensation nuclei. Despite their importance, there are limited studies investigating the effect of environmental variables on the bioaerosol composition in the Amazon rainforest. Here we present a 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing approach to investigate the bacterial microbiome in aerosols of the Amazon rainforest during distinct seasons and at different heights above the ground. Our data revealed that seasonal changes in temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation are the primary drivers of compositional changes in the Amazon rainforest aerosol microbiome. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial community composition of aerosols collected at ground and canopy levels. The core airborne bacterial families present in Amazon aerosol were Enterobacteriaceae, Beijerinckiaceae, Polyangiaceae, Bacillaceae and Ktedonobacteraceae. By correlating the bacterial taxa identified in the aerosol with literature data, we speculate that the phyllosphere may be one possible source of airborne bacteria in the Amazon rainforest. Results of this study indicate that the aerosol microbiota of the Amazon Rainforest are fairly diverse and principally impacted by seasonal changes in temperature and humidity.},

abstract={It is known that different plant species select specific microbes to live inside their tissues in a process determined by the host genotype, phenotype and geographic location, which can introduce discussion on plant endemism and the assembly of specific microbial communities. Herein, we report the results of an investigation relating the geographic distribution of plant species and the composition of microbial communities associated with plant hosts. The bacterial and fungal community associated with Anthurium plant leaves was mapped to assess the diversity and ecology of the endophytic community associated with Anthurium spp. collected on islands and on the Brazilian mainland. Twenty-six Anthurium specimens were surveyed, distributed throughout the Sao Paulo state coastline, including Alcatrazes Island, some coastal islands and distinct mainland environments. Bacterial and fungal endophytes were obtained from the leaves of A. alcatrazense, A. loefgrenii, A. penthaphyllum, A. urvellianum and A. intermedium and subjected to massive bacterial 16S rRNA and fungal ITS sequencing. The results indicated that A. alcatrazense, endemic to Alcatrazes Island, hosted a specific bacterial community structure, while its fungal community was similar to that of Anthurium species from other locations. Betaproteobacteria showed a high differential occurrence in A. alcatrazense. Some groups of fungi were found mainly inhabiting A. loefgrenii plants. While Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Sordariomycetes, Dothiodeomycetes and Tremellomycetes composed the core microbial community among Anthurium plants. The results suggest crucial role for the bacterial communities to endemic plants, while endophytic fungal diversity is less specifically distributed among endemic and nonendemic plant species.},

abstract={Phenotypic plasticity is a rapid response mechanism that enable organisms to acclimate and survive in changing environments. Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) survives and thrives in different and even invasive habitats, thereby indicating its high phenotypic plasticity. However, the underpinnings of the high plasticity of E. sinensis are not comprehensively investigated. In this study, we conducted the integrated gut microbiome and muscle metabolome analysis on E. sinensis collected from three different environments, namely, artificial pond, Yangcheng Lake, and Yangtze River, to uncover the mechanism of high phenotypic plasticity of E. sinensis. Our study presented three divergent gut microbiotas and muscle metabolic profiles that corresponded to the three environments. The composition and diversity of the core gut microbiota (Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, and Firmicutes) varied among the different environments. Meanwhile, the metabolites associated with amino acids, fatty acids, and terpene compounds displayed significantly different concentration levels in the three environments. Results revealed that the gut microbiome community and muscle metabolome were significantly affected by the habitat environments. This finding indicated the high phenotypic plasticity in terms of gut microbiome and muscle metabolome of E. sinensis when it faces environmental changes, which would benefit acclimation and adaptation to diverse and even invasive environments.},

abstract={Marine sponges are excellent examples of invertebrate-microbe symbioses. In this holobiont, the partnership has elegantly evolved by either transmitting key microbial associates through the host germline and/or capturing microorganisms from the surrounding seawater. We report here on the prokaryotic microbiota during different developmental stages of Plakina cyanorosea and their surrounding environmental samples by a 16S rRNA metabarcoding approach. In comparison with their source adults, larvae housed slightly richer and more diverse microbial communities, which are structurally more related to the environmental microbiota. In addition to the thaumarchaeal Nitrosopumilus, parental sponges were broadly dominated by Alpha- and Gamma-proteobacteria, while the offspring were particularly enriched in the Vibrionales, Alteromonodales, Enterobacterales orders and the Clostridia and Bacteroidia classes. An enterobacterial operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was the dominant member of the strict core microbiota. The most abundant and unique OTUs were not significantly enriched amongst the microbiomes from host specimens included in the sponge microbiome project. In a wider context, Oscarella and Plakina are the sponge genera with higher divergence in their associated microbiota compared to their Homoscleromorpha counterparts. Our results indicate that P. cyanorosea is a low microbial abundance sponge (LMA), which appears to heavily depend on the horizontal transmission of its microbial partners that likely help the sponge host in the adaptation to its habitat.},

abstract={Increasing temperatures and drought in desert ecosystems are predicted to cause decreased vegetation density combined with barren ground expansion. It remains unclear how nutrient availability, microbial diversity, and the associated functional capacity vary between vegetated-canopy and gap soils. The specific aim of this study was to characterize canopy vs gap microsite effect on soil microbial diversity, the capacity of gap soils to serve as a canopy-soil microbial reservoir, nitrogen (N)-mineralization genetic potential (ureC gene abundance) and urease enzyme activity, and microbial-nutrient pool associations in four arid-hyperarid geolocations of the western Sonoran Desert, Arizona (USA). Microsite combined with geolocation explained 57% and 45.8% of the observed variation in bacterial/archaeal and fungal community composition, respectively. A core microbiome of amplicon sequence variants was shared between the canopy and gap soil communities; however, canopy-soils included abundant taxa that were not present in associated gap communities, thereby suggesting that these taxa cannot be sourced from the associated gap soils. Linear mixed-effects models showed that canopy-soils have significantly higher microbial richness, nutrient content, and organic N-mineralization genetic and functional capacity. Furthermore, ureC gene abundance was detected in all samples suggesting that ureC is a relevant indicator of N-mineralization in deserts. Additionally, novel phylogenetic associations were observed for ureC with the majority belonging to Actinobacteria and uncharacterized bacteria. Thus, key N-mineralization functional capacity is associated with a dominant desert phylum. Overall, these results suggest that lower microbial diversity and functional capacity in gap soils may impact ecosystem sustainability as aridity drives open-space expansion in deserts.},

abstract={Intestine microbiota is tightly associated with host health status. Increasing studies have focused on assessing how host intestine microbiota is affected by biotic factors but ignored abiotic factors. Here, we aimed to understand the effects of salinity on shrimp intestine microbiota, by comparing the differences of intestine bacterial signatures of shrimp under low-salinity (LS) and high-salinity (HS) culture conditions. Our results found that intestine core bacterial taxa of shrimp under LS and HS culture conditions were different and that under HS contained more opportunistic pathogen species. Notably, compared with LS culture conditions, opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Vibrio species) were enriched in shrimp intestine under HS. Network analysis revealed that shrimp under HS culture conditions exhibited less connected and lower competitive intestine bacterial interspecies interactions compared with LS. In addition, under HS culture conditions, several opportunistic pathogens were identified as keystone species of intestine bacterial network in shrimp. Furthermore, the ecological drift process played a more important role in the intestine bacterial assembly of shrimp under HS culture conditions than that under LS. These above traits regarding the intestine microbiota of shrimp under HS culture conditions might lead to host at a higher risk of disease. Collectively, this work aids our understanding of the effects of salinity on shrimp intestine microbiota and helps for shrimp culture.},

abstract={Mining activities of antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As) typically result in severe environmental contamination. These contaminants accumulate in rice and thus threaten the health of local residents, who consume Sb- and As-enriched rice grains. Microorganisms play a critical role in the transformation and transportation of Sb and As in paddy soil. Thus, an understanding of the microbiology of contaminated sites would promote the production of safe agricultural products. In this study, six Sb- and As-contaminated rice fields near an active Sb-mining area were investigated. The Sb and As concentrations of all samples were elevated compared to the background level in China. Nitrate, total As, total Sb, and Fe(III) were the major determinants of the microbial community structure. Seven bacterial taxa (i.e. Bradyrhizobium, Bryobacter, Candidatus Solibacter, Geobacter, Gemmatimonas, Halingium, and Sphingomonas) were identified as the core microbiome. These taxa were strongly correlated with the As and Sb contaminant fractions and likely to metabolize As and Sb. Results imply that many soil microbes can survival in the Sb/As contaminated sites.},

abstract={Small open reading frames (smORFs) and their encoded microproteins play central roles in microbes. However, there is a vast unexplored space of smORFs within human-associated microbes. A recent bioinformatic analysis used evolutionary conservation signals to enhance prediction of small protein families. To facilitate the annotation of specific smORFs, we introduce SmORFinder. This tool combines profile hidden Markov models of each smORF family and deep learning models that better generalize to smORF families not seen in the training set, resulting in predictions enriched for Ribo-seq translation signals. Feature importance analysis reveals that the deep learning models learn to identify Shine-Dalgarno sequences, deprioritize the wobble position in each codon, and group codon synonyms found in the codon table. A core-genome analysis of 26 bacterial species identifies several core smORFs of unknown function. We pre-compute smORF annotations for thousands of RefSeq isolate genomes and Human Microbiome Project metagenomes and provide these data through a public web portal.},

abstract={Guizhou Suantang (GZST), a type of sour soup, is a traditional fermented food that can be classified into Hong Suantang (HST) and Bai Suantang (BST). GZST possesses unique flavors arising from various microbiota in fermentation ecosystems. However, the association between these microbiota and flavors remains poorly understood. Accordingly, this study analyzed the volatile components and microbial communities of GZST via headspace solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-throughput 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer sequencing techniques. Results showed that 133 compounds, including alcohols, esters, phenols, hydrocarbons, ketones, aldehydes, nitriles, acids, and sulfides, were identified from GZST. Moreover, principal component analysis found significant variances in the composition of volatile compounds among different samples. The bacterial genus level indicated that all GZST samples were dominated by Lactobacillus. At the fungal genus level, BST was dominated by Pichia, Debaryomyces, Mortierella, unclassified, Meyerozyma, and Dipodascus. Meanwhile, HST was dominated by Pichia, Candida, Kazachstania, Debaryomyces, Archaeorhizomyces, and Verticillium. The potential correlations between microbiota and volatile components were also explored through bidirectional orthogonal partial least squares-based correlation analysis. Nine bacterial genera and eight fungal taxa were identified as functional core microbiota for flavor production on the basis of their dominance and functionality in the microbial community. In addition, excessive Lactobacillus inhibited the formation of certain flavor substances. These findings provided basic data for the isolation, screening, and fermentation regulation of functional microorganisms in GZST. The information provided in this study is valuable for the development of effective strategies for selecting beneficial bacterial and fungal strains to improve the quality of GZST.},

abstract={Production of leafy vegetables for the "Ready-to-eat"-market has vastly increased the last 20 years, and consumption of these minimally processed vegetables has led to outbreaks of food-borne diseases. Contamination of leafy vegetables can occur throughout the production chain, and therefore washing of the produce has become a standard in commercial processing. This study explores the bacterial communities of spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia) in a commercial setting in order to identify potential contamination events, and to investigate effects on bacterial load by commercial processing. Samples were taken in field, after washing of the produce and at the end of shelf-life. This study found that the bacterial community composition and diversity changed significantly from the first harvest to the end of shelf-life, where the core microbiome from the first to the last sampling constituted <2% of all OTUs. While washing of the produce had no reducing effect on bacterial load compared to unwashed, washing led to a change in species composition. As the leaves entered the cold chain after harvest, a rise was seen in the relative abundance of spoilage bacteria. E. coli was detected after the washing indicating issues of cross-contamination in the wash water.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Lung microbiota profiles in patients with early idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have been associated with disease progression; however, the topographic heterogeneity of lung microbiota and their roles in advanced IPF are unknown. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, case-control study of explanted lung tissue obtained at the time of lung transplantation or rapid autopsy from patients with IPF and other chronic lung diseases (connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung disease (CTD-ILD), cystic fibrosis (CF), COPD and donor lungs unsuitable for transplant from Center for Organ Recovery and Education (CORE)). We sampled subpleural tissue and airway-based specimens (bronchial washings and airway tissue) and quantified bacterial load and profiled communities by amplification and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. FINDINGS: Explants from 62 patients with IPF, 15 patients with CTD-ILD, 20 patients with CF, 20 patients with COPD and 20 CORE patients were included. Airway-based samples had higher bacterial load compared with distal parenchymal tissue. IPF basilar tissue had much lower bacterial load compared with CF and CORE lungs (p<0.001). No microbial community differences were found between parenchymal tissue samples from different IPF lobes. Dirichlet multinomial models revealed an IPF cluster (29%) with distinct composition, high bacterial load and low alpha diversity, exhibiting higher odds for acute exacerbation or death. INTERPRETATION: IPF explants had low biomass in the distal parenchyma of all three lobes with higher bacterial load in the airways. The discovery of a distinct subgroup of patients with IPF with higher bacterial load and worse clinical outcomes supports investigation of personalised medicine approaches for microbiome-targeted interventions.},

abstract={Microbial communities infiltrate the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients, where chronic colonization and infection lead to clinical decline. This report aims to provide an overview of the diversity of bacterial and fungal species from the airway secretion of three young CF patients with severe pulmonary disease. The bacterial and fungal microbiomes were investigated by culture isolation, metataxonomics, and metagenomics shotgun. Virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes were also explored. A. fumigatus was isolated from cultures and identified in high incidence from patient sputum samples. Candida albicans, Penicillium sp., Hanseniaspora sp., Torulaspora delbrueckii, and Talaromyces amestolkiae were isolated sporadically. Metataxonomics and metagenomics detected fungal reads (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, A. fumigatus, and Schizophyllum sp.) in one sputum sample. The main pathogenic bacteria identified were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia complex, and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. The canonical core CF microbiome is composed of species from the genera Streptococcus, Neisseria, Rothia, Prevotella, and Haemophilus. Thus, the airways of the three young CF patients presented dominant bacterial genera and interindividual variability in microbial community composition and diversity. Additionally, a wide diversity of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes were identified in the CF lung microbiomes, which may be linked to the clinical condition of the CF patients. Understanding the microbial community is crucial to improve therapy because it may have the opposite effect, restructuring the pathogenic microbiota. Future studies focusing on the influence of fungi on bacterial diversity and microbial interactions in CF microbiomes will be welcome to fulfill this huge gap of fungal influence on CF physiopathology.},

abstract={The use of additives in food products has become an important public health concern. In recent reports, dietary emulsifiers have been shown to affect the gut microbiota, contributing to a pro-inflammatory phenotype and metabolic syndrome. So far, it is not yet known whether similar microbiome shifts are observable for a more diverse set of emulsifier types and to what extent these effects vary with the unique features of an individual's microbiome. To bridge this gap, we investigated the effect of five dietary emulsifiers on the fecal microbiota from 10 human individuals upon a 48 h exposure. Community structure was assessed with quantitative microbial profiling, functionality was evaluated by measuring fermentation metabolites, and pro-inflammatory properties were assessed with the phylogenetic prediction algorithm PICRUSt, together with a TLR5 reporter cell assay for flagellin. A comparison was made between two mainstream chemical emulsifiers (carboxymethylcellulose and P80), a natural extract (soy lecithin), and biotechnological emulsifiers (sophorolipids and rhamnolipids). While fecal microbiota responded in a donor-dependent manner to the different emulsifiers, profound differences between emulsifiers were observed. Rhamnolipids, sophorolipids, and soy lecithin eliminated 91 +/- 0, 89 +/- 1, and 87 +/- 1% of the viable bacterial population after 48 h, yet they all selectively increased the proportional abundance of putative pathogens. Moreover, profound shifts in butyrate (-96 +/- 6, -73 +/- 24, and -34 +/- 25%) and propionate (+13 +/- 24, +88 +/- 50, and +29 +/- 16%) production were observed for these emulsifiers. Phylogenetic prediction indicated higher motility, which was, however, not confirmed by increased flagellin levels using the TLR5 reporter cell assay. We conclude that dietary emulsifiers can severely impact the gut microbiota, and this seems to be proportional to their emulsifying strength, rather than emulsifier type or origin. As biotechnological emulsifiers were especially more impactful than chemical emulsifiers, caution is warranted when considering them as more natural alternatives for clean label strategies.},

abstract={The tolerance of aerobic granular sludge (AGS) to variable wastewater composition is perceived as one of its greatest advantages compared to other aerobic processes. However, research studies select optimal operational conditions for evaluating AGS performance, such as the use of pre-adapted biomass and the control of wastewater composition. In this study, non-adapted granular sludge was used to treat fish canning wastewater presenting highly variable organic, nutrient and salt levels over a period of ca. 8 months. Despite salt levels up to 14 g NaCl L(-1), the organic loading rate (OLR) was found to be the main factor driving AGS performance. Throughout the first months of operation, the OLR was generally lower than 1.2 kg COD m(-3) day(-1), resulting in stable nitrification and low COD and phosphorous levels at the outlet. An increase in OLR up to 2.3 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) disturbed nitrification and COD and phosphate removal, but a decrease to average values between 1 and 1.6 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) led to resuming of those processes. Most of the bacteria present in the AGS core microbiome were associated to extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) production, such as Thauera and Paracoccus, which increased during the higher OLR period. Ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) species were detected in AGS biomass; while AOB were identified throughout the operation, NOB were no further identified after the period of increased OLR. Different polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) were detected along the process: CandidatusAccumulibacter, Tetrasphaera and Gemmatimonas. A non-adapted granular sludge was able to treat the fish canning wastewater and to tolerate salinity fluctuations up to 14 g L(-1). Overall, a high microbial diversity associated to EPS producers allowed to preserve bacterial groups responsible for nutrients removal, contributing to the adaptation and long-term stability of the AGS system.},

abstract={Microorganisms attached to aquatic steel structures play key roles in nutrient cycling and structural degradation processes. Corrosion-causing microbes are often the focus of studies involving microbially influenced corrosion, yet the roles of remaining community members remain unclear. This study characterizes the composition and functional potential of a 'core steel microbiome' across stainless steel types (304 and 316) and historic shipwreck steel along salinity gradients in North Carolina estuaries. We found higher phylogenetic evenness and diversity on steel surfaces compared to sediment, and at lower salinities. The core steel microbiome was composed of heterotrophic generalist taxa, and community composition was most strongly influenced by salinity. Substrate type was a secondary factor becoming more influential at higher salinities. The core steel microbiome included members of Sphingobacteriia, Cytophagia, Anaerolineaceae, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Chitinophagaceae, and Rheinheimera. While salinity differences led to phylogenetic separations across microbial community assemblages, functional genes were conserved across salinity and steel type. Generalist taxa on steel surfaces likely provide functional stability and biofilm protection for the community with limited functional trade-offs compared to surrounding environments. Further, characterization of a core steel microbiome increases the understanding of these complex steel surface microbial communities and their similarities to core microbiomes in other environments.},

abstract={The sustainable management of small human communities in the Arctic is challenging. In this study, both a water supply system (Lake 1) under the natural impact of a bird-nesting area, and a wastewater receiver (Lake 2) were analysed in the vicinity of the Polish Polar Station on West Spitsbergen. Microbial community composition, abundance and activity were assessed in samples of the treated wastewater, lake water and sediments using next-generation sequencing and direct microscope counts. Special attention was given to the faecal indicator, Enterococcus spp., whose occurrence and antimicrobial resistance were tested in water and wastewater samples. The results indicate that Lake 1, at a tundra stream discharge (L-TS) and a water supply point (L-WS) were dominated by three phyla: Proteobacteria (57-58%) Bacteroidetes (27-29%) and Actinobacteria (9-10%), showing similar microbial composition up to the genus level. This suggests that nutrient-rich runoff from the bird colony was retained by surrounding tundra vegetation and reached Lake 1 at L-TS to a limited extent. Lake 2, being the wastewater recipient (WW-R), mirrors to some extent the core phyla of treated wastewater (WW-E), but in different shares. This suggests the possible washout of wastewater-related bacteria with activated sludge flocs, which was also supported by the microscopic observations. Compared to Lake 1, in WW-R an increase in all tested parameters was noted: total prokaryotic cell number, average cell volume, prokaryotic biomass and live cell percentage. The presence of Enterococcus spp. antibiotic resistance patterns highlight the importance of human associated microbiome and resistome dissemination via wastewater discharge. Moreover, it can be expected that temperature-related biochemical processes (e.g. nutrient cycling) may be accelerated by the ongoing climate change. Thus, proper wastewater treatment requires locally adapted solutions in increasingly visited and inhabited polar regions. Additionally, microbial community discharged to the environment with the treated wastewater, requires critical attention.},

abstract={The two-step model for plant root microbiomes considers soil as the primary microbial source. Active selection of the plant's bacterial inhabitants results in a biodiversity decrease toward roots. We collected sixteen samples of in situ ruderal plant roots and their soils and used these soils as the main microbial input for single genotype tomatoes grown in a greenhouse. Our main goal was to test the soil influence in the structuring of rhizosphere microbiomes, minimizing environmental variability, while testing multiple plant species. We massively sequenced the 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomes of the soils, in situ plants, and tomato roots. We identified a total of 271,940 bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within the soils, rhizosphere and endospheric microbiomes. We annotated by homology a total of 411,432 (13.07%) of the metagenome predicted proteins. Tomato roots did follow the two-step model with lower alpha-diversity than soil, while ruderal plants did not. Surprisingly, ruderal plants are probably working as a microenvironmental oasis providing moisture and plant-derived nutrients, supporting larger alpha-diversity. Ruderal plants and their soils are closer according to their microbiome community composition than tomato and its soil, based on OTUs and protein comparisons. We expected that tomato beta-diversity clustered together with their soil, if it is the main rhizosphere microbiome structuring factor. However, tomato microbiome beta-diversity was associated with plant genotype in most samples (81.2%), also supported by a larger set of enriched proteins in tomato rhizosphere than soil or ruderals. The most abundant bacteria found in soils was the Actinobacteria Solirubrobacter soli, ruderals were dominated by the Proteobacteria Sphingomonas sp. URGHD0057, and tomato mainly by the Bacteroidetes Ohtaekwangia koreensis, Flavobacterium terrae, Niastella vici, and Chryseolinea serpens. We calculated a metagenomic tomato root core of 51 bacterial genera and 2,762 proteins, which could be the basis for microbiome-oriented plant breeding programs. We attributed a larger diversity in ruderal plants roots exudates as an effect of the moisture and nutrient acting as a microbial harbor. The tomato and ruderal metagenomic differences are probably due to plant domestication trade-offs, impacting plant-bacteria interactions.},

abstract={The microbial community is an important part of the natural ecosystem, and the quorum sensing system is a momentous communication tool for the microbial community to connect to the surrounding environment. Quorum sensing is a process of cell-cell communication that relies on the production, release, and detection of extracellular signaling molecules, which are called autoinducers. Quorum sensing systems in bacteria consist of two main components: a receptor protein and an autoinducer. The binding of autoinducer to its receptor activates the target gene, which then performs the corresponding function in bacteria. In a natural environment, different bacterial species possess quorum sensing receptors that are structurally and functionally different. So far, many bacterial quorum sensing receptors have been identified and the structure and function of some receptors have been characterized. There are many reviews about quorum sensing and quorum sensing receptors, but there are few reviews that describe various types of quorum sensing in different environments with receptors as the core. Therefore, we summarize the well-defined quorum sensing receptors involved in intra-species and inter-species cell-cell communication, and describe the structure, function, and characteristics of typical receptors for different types of quorum sensing. A systematic understanding of quorum sensing receptors will help researchers to further explore the signaling mechanism and regulation mechanism of quorum sensing system, provide help to clarify the role and function of quorum sensing in natural ecosystems, then provide theoretical basis for the discovery or synthesis of new targeted drugs that block quorum sensing.},

abstract={Constructing an effective control strategy for the daily operation of sewage treatment plants daily operation is an important criterion for the removal performances of nutrient stable in winter. To investigate microbial community structure, functional groups, and relationships between population dynamics and effluent variation, activated sludge obtained from 4 plants, which were running stably in a low temperature period (8-15) in northern China, were sampled. The high-throughput sequencing results indicated that the microbial community had good richness in the low temperature period during which the abundance of Actinobacteria increased. Nitrosomonas, a key functional ammonia oxidation bacterium, was greatly affected by the decreasing temperature, while Denitrifies, a highly diverse core group with wide distribution, maintained stable abundance indicating less influence of decreasing temperature. The denitrification efficiency was only associated with the mixed liquor reflux ratio. Tetrasphaera was widely present in four processes and played an important role for the removal of biological phosphorus. Sludge bulking phenomena caused by filamentous bacteria overgrowth occurred frequently in winter; however the quality of effluents was slightly influenced.},

abstract={Environments in both biotic and abiotic ecosystems have been affected by the colonization of non-native flora. In this study, we examined the effect of Bidens alba invasion on different land-use types along a coastline in southern China. Bacterial communities in each site were determined using 16S rDNA sequencing, and soil physicochemical properties were analyzed using standard methods. Although our results indicated that B. alba invasion did not have a significant effect on the alpha diversity of bacteria, it caused significant differences in soil bacterial community composition between invaded and uninvaded soil across different land-use types. Beta diversity and several physicochemical properties in forest, orchard and waterfront environments were recorded to be more susceptible to B. alba invasion. A high proportion of the variation of bacterial communities can be explained by a combination of environmental variables, indicating that environmental selection rather than plant invasion is a more effective process in coastal microbial assemblages. By comparing topological roles of shared OTUs among invaded and uninvaded soil, keystone taxa in invaded soil were identified. Acidobacteria was the major phyla involved in the invasive process which could be driven by environmental selection. How key phyla react in our experiment should be verified by further studies.},

abstract={Despite the risks that hydrocarbon contamination from pipeline leaks or train derailments impose on the health of peatlands in hydrocarbon production areas and transportation corridors, assessing the effect of such contaminations on the health and sustainability of peatlands has received little attention. This study investigates the impacts of hydrocarbons on peat microbial communities. Column experiments were conducted on non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) contaminated undisturbed peat core (0-35 cm) under static and fluctuating water table conditions. Water table fluctuations reduced residual NAPL saturation from 8.1-11.3% to 7.7-9.5%. Biodegradation of n-C8 and n-C12 along with oxidation of CH4 together produced high CO2 concentrations in the headspace. Clear patterns in dynamics in the microbial community structure were observed, with a more pronounced population growth. However, a significant loss of microbial richness was observed in contaminated columns. The result indicates that the phylum Proteobacteria benefited most from NAPL; however, their families differed between static and fluctuating water table conditions. This study established strong evidence that peat microbes and water table fluctuation can be an excellent tool for hydrocarbon removal and its control in peatlands.},

abstract={Learning more about the biodiversity and composition of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) under alternative agricultural management scenarios may be important to the sustainable intensification of switchgrass grown as a bioenergy crop. Using PacBio single-molecule sequencing and taxonomic resolution to the level of amplicon sequence variant (ASV), we assessed the effects of nitrogen amendment on AMF associating with switchgrass and explored relationships between AMF and switchgrass yield across three sites of various productivities in Wisconsin. Nitrogen amendment had little effect on AMF diversity metrics or community composition. While AMF ASV diversity was not correlated with switchgrass yield, AMF family richness and switchgrass yield had a strong, positive relationship at one of our three sites. Each of our sites was dominated by unique ASVs of the species Paraglomus brasilianum, indicating regional segregation of AMF at the intraspecific level. Our molecular biodiversity survey identified putative core members of the switchgrass microbiome, as well as novel clades of AMF, especially in the order Paraglomerales and the genus Nanoglomus Furthermore, our phylogenies unite the cosmopolitan, soil-inhabiting clade deemed GS24 with Pervetustaceae, an enigmatic family prevalent in stressful environments. Future studies should isolate and characterize the novel genetic diversity found in switchgrass agroecosystems and explore the potential yield benefits of AMF richness.IMPORTANCE We assessed the different species of beneficial fungi living in agricultural fields of switchgrass, a large grass grown for biofuels, using high-resolution DNA sequencing. Contrary to our expectations, the fungi were not greatly affected by fertilization. However, we found a positive relationship between plant productivity and the number of families of beneficial fungi at one site. Furthermore, we sequenced many species that could not be identified with existing reference databases. One group of fungi was highlighted in an earlier study for being widely distributed but of unknown taxonomy. We discovered that this group belonged to a family called Pervetustaceae, which may benefit switchgrass in stressful environments. To produce higher-yielding switchgrass in a more sustainable manner, it could help to study these undescribed fungi and the ways in which they may contribute to greater switchgrass yield in the absence of fertilization.},

abstract={Fungi are known to play important roles in pollutant transformation in activated sludge-based wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). However, the seasonality and distributions of fungal populations in different-sized flocs have still remained largely unknown. In this study, seasonal population dynamics and community separation of fungi in a municipal WWTP across a 1-year period were investigated. We classified all taxa into six categories based on abundances to assess their roles and contributions to the whole community. The results showed that the rare taxa (<0.01%) contributed greatly to species richness (95.27%). Conversely, although low in species diversity, abundant taxa (>/=1%) accounted for the majority (89.45%) of the total relative abundance, which suggested that a few core abundant fungi existed in the activated sludge ecosystem. The abundant, conditionally rare, and rare taxa contributed 30.14%, 31.11%, and 38.75%, respectively, to temporal shifts in community structure, and their abundances responded differently to environmental variables, suggesting that these three subcommunities exhibited a large difference in environmental sensitivity. Importantly, the results revealed seasonal dynamics of the whole fungal community and the subcommunities of all the microbial taxon categories, resulting in significant differences in community structures between warm and cold seasons. Furthermore, fungal diversity and the compositions of the whole community and subcommunities differed significantly among flocs of different sizes, which underlined the size-based fungal community separation in activated sludge of WWTPs. The findings of this work improved our understanding of fungal population dynamics and community separation in WWTPs.IMPORTANCE Fungi are important contributors to the various functions of activated sludge in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Unlike previous studies, this work demonstrated the seasonality of the fungal community over a longer time span while it also systematically assessed the contributions of abundant, conditionally rare, and rare taxa to the whole community. Importantly, in the present study, we considered sludge flocs of a certain size range rather than the whole sludge flocs as a community. Our results revealed significant differences in fungal community structure among different-sized flocs, which supported the idea that size-based fungal community segregation is occurring in activated sludge ecosystems. The findings provide new insights into the dynamic changes or distribution of fungi in the bioaggregates of sludge flocs in WWTPs.},

abstract={The taxonomic composition of microbial communities can vary substantially across habitats and within the same habitat over time. Efforts to build quantitative and predictive models of microbial population dynamics are underway, but fundamental questions remain. How different are population dynamics in different environments? Do communities that share the same taxa also exhibit identical dynamics? In vitro communities can help establish baseline expectations that are critical towards resolving these questions in natural communities. Here, we applied a recently developed tool, Dissimilarity-Overlap Analysis (DOA), to a set of experimental in vitro communities that differed in nutrient composition. The Dissimilarity and Overlap of these communities are negatively correlated in replicate habitats, as one would expect if microbial population dynamics were on average strongly convergent (or "universal") across these replicate habitats. However, the existence of such a negative correlation does not necessarily imply that population dynamics are always universal in all communities. Even in replicate, identical habitats, two different communities may contain the same set of taxa at different abundances in equilibrium. The formation of alternative states in community assembly is strongly associated with the presence of specific taxa in the communities. Our results benchmark DOA, providing support for some of its core assumptions, and suggest that communities sharing the same taxa and external abiotic factors generally (but not necessarily) have a negative correlation between Dissimilarity and Overlap.},

abstract={The objective of this study was to explore the correlation between bacterial communities and volatile compounds in traditional dry sausages from different regions in Northeast China. The bacterial community structure of dry sausages from five different regions as determined by high-throughput sequencing technology demonstrated that Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla; Lactobacillus, Staphylococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactococcus and Weissella were the predominant genera; and Staphylococcus xylosus, Lactobacillus sakei, Weissella hellenica, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactococcus raffinolactis and Lactobacillus plantarum were the predominant species. Meanwhile, a total of 120 volatile compounds were detected in sausages from five different regions and mainly included alcohols, acids, aldehydes, ketones, esters and terpenes. Furthermore, the potential correlations between the core bacteria and major volatile compounds (64) were explored based on Spearman's correlation analysis. Positive correlations were found between W. hellenica, Lb. sakei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Lb. plantarum and carboxylic acids and alcohols. Lc. lactis, Lb. alimentarius and Lb. plantarum were associated with the production of most esters, aldehydes and ketones. This study provides a deep insight into the relationship between the bacterial community and the volatile flavour profile of dry sausages, which may be helpful for the production of fermented dry sausages.},

abstract={The Honghe Hani rice terraces system (HHRTS) is a traditional rice cultivation system where Hani people cultivate remarkably diverse rice varieties. Recent introductions of modern rice varieties to the HHRTS have significantly increased the severity of rice diseases within the terraces. Here, we determine the impacts of these recent introductions on the composition of the rice-associated microbial communities. We confirm that the HHRTS contains a range of both traditional HHRTS landraces and introduced modern rice varieties and find differences between the microbial communities of these two groups. However, this introduction of modern rice varieties has not strongly impacted the overall diversity of the HHRTS rice microbial community. Furthermore, we find that the rice varieties (i.e. groups of closely related genotypes) have significantly structured the rice microbial community composition (accounting for 15%-22% of the variance) and that the core microbial community of HHRTS rice plants represents less than 3.3% of all the microbial taxa identified. Collectively, our study suggests a highly diverse HHRTS rice holobiont (host with its associated microbes) where the diversity of rice hosts mirrors the diversity of their microbial communities. Further studies will be needed to better determine how such changes might impact the sustainability of the HHRTS.},

abstract={Endophytic fungi compose a significant part of plant microbiomes. However, while a small number of fungal taxa have proven beneficial impact, the vast majority of fungal endophytes remain uncharacterized, and the drivers of fungal endophyte community (FEC) assembly are not well understood. Here, we analysed FECs in three cereal crops-related wild grasses - Avena sterilis, Hordeum spontaneum and Aegilops peregrina - that grow in mixed populations in natural habitats. Taxa in Ascomycota class Dothideomycetes, particularly the genera Alternaria and Cladosporium, were the most abundant and prevalent across all populations, but there was also high incidence of basidiomyceteous yeasts of the class Tremellomycetes. The fungal community was shaped to large extent by stochastic processes, as indicated by high level of variation even between individuals from local populations of the same plant species, and confirmed by the neutral community model and Raup-Crick index. Nevertheless, we still found strong determinism in FEC assembly with both incidence and abundance data sets. Substantial differences in community composition across host species and locations were revealed. Our research demonstrated that assembly of FECs is affected by stochastic as well as deterministic processes and suggests strong effects of environment heterogeneity and plant species on community composition. In addition, a small number of taxa had high incidence and abundance in all of the 15 populations. These taxa represent an important part of the core FEC and might be of general functional importance.},

abstract={Cover cropping is proposed to enhance soil microbial diversity and activity, with cover crop type affecting microbial groups in different ways. We compared fungal community compositions of bulk soils differing by cover crop treatment, season, and edaphic properties in the third year of an organic, conventionally tilled rotation of corn-soybean-wheat planted with winter cover crops. We used Illumina amplicon sequencing fungal assemblages to evaluate effects of nine treatments, each replicated four times, consisting of six single winter cover crop species, a three-species mixture, a six-species mixture, and fallow. Alpha-diversity of fungal communities was not affected by cover crop species identity, function, or diversity. Sampling season influenced community composition as well as genus-level abundances of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Cover crop mixtures, specifically the three-species mixture, had distinct AM fungal community compositions, while cereal rye and forage radish monocultures had unique Core OTU compositions. Soil texture, pH, permanganate oxidizable carbon, and chemical properties including Cu, and P were important variables in models of fungal OTU distributions across groupings. These results showed how fungal composition and potential functions were shaped by cover crop treatment as well as soil heterogeneity.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: The shade represents one of the major environmental limitations for turfgrass growth. Shade influences plant growth and alters plant metabolism, yet little is known about how shade affects the structure of rhizosphere soil microbial communities and the role of soil microorganisms in plant shade responses. In this study, a glasshouse experiment was conducted to examine the impact of shade on the growth and photosynthetic capacity of two contrasting shade-tolerant turfgrasses, shade-tolerant dwarf lilyturf (Ophiopogon japonicus, OJ) and shade-intolerant perennial turf-type ryegrass (Lolium perenne, LP). We also examined soil-plant feedback effects on shade tolerance in the two turfgrass genotypes. The composition of the soil bacterial community was assayed using high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: OJ maintained higher photosynthetic capacity and root growth than LP under shade stress, thus OJ was found to be more shade-tolerant than LP. Shade-intolerant LP responded better to both shade and soil microbes than shade-tolerant OJ. The shade and live soil decreased LP growth, but increased biomass allocation to shoots in the live soil. The plant shade response index of LP is higher in live soil than sterile soil, driven by weakened soil-plant feedback under shade stress. In contrast, there was no difference in these values for OJ under similar shade and soil treatments. Shade stress had little impact on the diversity of the OJ and the LP bacterial communities, but instead impacted their composition. The OJ soil bacterial communities were mostly composed of Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria. Further pairwise fitting analysis showed that a positive correlation of shade-tolerance in two turfgrasses and their bacterial community compositions. Several soil properties (NO3(-)-N, NH4(+)-N, AK) showed a tight coupling with several major bacterial communities under shade stress. Moreover, OJ shared core bacterial taxa known to promote plant growth and confer tolerance to shade stress, which suggests common principles underpinning OJ-microbe interactions. CONCLUSION: Soil microorganisms mediate plant responses to shade stress via plant-soil feedback and shade-induced change in the rhizosphere soil bacterial community structure for OJ and LP plants. These findings emphasize the importance of understanding plant-soil interactions and their role in the mechanisms underlying shade tolerance in shade-tolerant turfgrasses.},

abstract={The microbial ecosystems of the sludge were characterized in terms of the core community structure, functional pathways, and functional redundancy through Illumina MiSeq sequencing and PICRUSt analysis on the activated sludge (AS) samples from an extended activated aeration process. Based on the identified OTU distribution, we identified 125 core community genera, including 3 abundant core genera and 21 intermittent abundant core genera. Putative genera Nitrosomonas, Nitrotoga, Zoogloea, Novosphingobium, Thermomonas, Amaricoccus, Tetrasphaera, Candidatus Microthrix, and Haliscomenobacter, which are associated with functions of nitrifying, denitrifying, phosphorus accumulating, and bulking and foaming, were found to present as the core community organisms in the AS sampled from the conventional extended aeration AS processes. The high-abundant nitrogen metabolic pathways were associated with nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA and ANRA), denitrification, and nitrogen fixation, while the ammonia oxidation-related genes (amo) were rarely annotated in the AS samples. Strict functional redundancy was not found with the AS ecosystem as it showed a high correlation between the community composition similarity and function similarity. In addition, the classified dominant core genera community was found to be sufficient to characterize the functionality of AS, which could invigorate applications of 16S rDNA MiSeq sequencing and PICRUSt for the prediction of functions of AS ecosystems.},

abstract={Parsing the relative importance of environmental (recent disturbances) and spatial factors (historical processes) in determining community structure is a core issue in ecology. The Bohai Bay is a typical semi-enclosed bay located in the north of China, surrounding by the metropolitan area with anthropogenic disturbances made it a complex marine coastal system with pollution gradients, where the distributions and determinants of bacterioplankton communities remain unclear. In this study, we collected surface water samples from 19 sites across Bohai Bay at about 100 km scale to investigate the relative roles of local environments and regional spatial factors in shaping bacterioplankton community composition (BCC). The environmental parameters in the sampling region showed gradient change according to the geographic variation. Several abundant OTUs were significantly correlated with the pollution parameters in the studied area, and 16 OTUs of them showed distinct distribution pattern in different polluted regions with obvious geographic segmentation, which indicated the effects of pollution gradient and dispersal limitation on specific taxon. The BCCs did not show obviously clustering effect between different polluted regions, which indicated the complexity for explaining the BCC variation in the studied region. The partial Mantel test revealed stronger spatial effects on beta diversity than those of local environmental factors, which indicated that dispersal limitation accounted more for the beta diversity than environmental heterogeneity. Furthermore, variation partitioning analysis (VPA) conducted by combining the environmental variables, linear trends, and principal coordinates of the variables from neighbor matrices (PCNM) showed that it was the joint effects of environmental and spatial factors contributed to the explained variation of BCC in the studied area. Considering the special human geography characteristics of Bohai Bay, the unmeasured biotic/abiotic factors, stochastic factors, and anthropogenic disturbances may be responsible for the unexplained variation of the BCC.},

abstract={Crude oil is a serious soil pollutant, requiring large-scale remediation efforts. Bacterial consortia in combination with rhamnolipids can be an effective bioremediation method. However, the underlying mechanisms and associated changes in soil bacterial composition remain uncharacterized. Therefore, this study sought to evaluate the effectiveness of rhamnolipids in petroleum hydrocarbon removal, and the associated bacterial community dynamics during bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soils. Contaminated soils were subjected to natural attenuation, bioremediation with rhamnolipids, bioremediation with bacterial consortia, or bioremediation with bacterial consortia supplemented with rhamnolipids (BMR). High-throughput sequencing of bacterial sample partial 16S rRNA sequences was performed. Additionally, the n-alkanes and aromatic fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. The results showed that rhamnolipid supplementation increased the rate and extent of total petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation to a maximum of 81% within 35 days. Further, phylogenetic analysis revealed that the bacterial community was composed of 14 phylotypes (similarity level = 97%). Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the two core phyla in all samples, accounting for 63-89%, but Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum in the BMR sample (~ 53%). Among the top 20 genera, Pseudomonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Cavicella, Mycobacterium, Rhizobium, and Acinetobacter were more abundant in BMR samples compared to other samples. Predicted functional profiles revealed that rhamnolipid addition also induced changes in gene abundance related to hydrocarbon metabolic pathways. This study provided comprehensive insights into the synergistic effect of rhamnolipids and bacterial consortia for altering bacterial populations and specific functional traits, which may serve to improve bacteria-mediated petroleum hydrocarbon biodegradation in contaminated soils.},

Topological features of co-occurrence network showed geographic patterns wherein fungal assemblages were less complex, but more modular in island regions than mainland ones. Moreover, fungal interactions and community composition were strongly influenced by the genetic differentiation of host plants.

abstract={Bacterial communities in the activated sludge (AS) determine the wastewater treatment performance in the municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Aiming at identifying the affecting factors and the variation patterns of the bacterial assemblages in AS, a 2-year time-series AS samples were collected from two separated WWTPs and metagenomic sequencing was conducted. Obvious seasonal shift and succession of the bacterial community were observed in both WWTPs on the genus and species levels, especially for the persistent taxa, implying that temperature was a decisive factor for maintaining bacterial assemblage patterns in long-term period. Taxa abundance distribution (TAD) concerning occurrence frequency and average abundance were found fitting for exponential formulations, and the approximately equal total abundance of persistent taxa suggested that stable and high abundance (~ 90%) of core functional bacterial groups would help to maintain wastewater treatment performance. Drastic changes of environmental factors were found causing temporally significant bacterial structure variation, while the innate correlations between bacterial species could recover the community gradually and maintain relative stability of the AS system. Delayed correlations between environmental factors and abundant (persistent or intermittent) bacterial species were observed widely, while synchronous biotic interactions were identified more frequently. Besides, bacterial species with similar functions were prone to cluster together and shared the same seasonal variation pattern, implicating that the cooperation of functional correlated taxa played the most dominant role in shaping the bacterial assemblages. Furthermore, rare bacterial groups were to be explored for removing emerging pollutants with lower concentrations. The results of this study would assist dealing with operational defect and optimize the treatment system in WWTPs.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Sharks are in severe global decline due to human exploitation. The additional concern of emerging diseases for this ancient group of fish, however, remains poorly understood. While wild-caught and captive sharks may be susceptible to bacterial and transmissible diseases, recent reports suggest that shark skin may harbor properties that prevent infection, such as a specialized ultrastructure or innate immune properties, possibly related to associated microbial assemblages. To assess whether bacterial community composition differs between visibly healthy and insulted (injured) shark skin, we compared bacterial assemblages of skin covering the gills and the back from 44 wild-caught black-tip reef sharks (Carcharhinus melanopterus) from the Amirante Islands (Seychelles) via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: Shark skin-associated bacterial communities were diverse (5971 bacterial taxa from 375 families) and dominated by three families of the phylum Proteobacteria typical of marine organisms and environments (Rhodobacteraceae, Alteromonadaceae, Halomonadaceae). Significant differences in bacterial community composition of skin were observed for sharks collected from different sites, but not between healthy or injured skin samples or skin type (gills vs. back). The core microbiome (defined as bacterial taxa present in >/=50% of all samples) consisted of 12 bacterial taxa, which are commonly observed in marine organisms, some of which may be associated with animal host health. CONCLUSION: The conserved bacterial community composition of healthy and injured shark skin samples suggests absence of severe bacterial infections or substantial pathogen propagation upon skin insult. While a mild bacterial infection may have gone undetected, the overall conserved bacterial community implies that bacterial function(s) may be maintained in injured skin. At present, the contribution of bacteria, besides intrinsic animal host factors, to counter skin infection and support rapid wound healing in sharks are unknown. This represents clear knowledge gaps that should be addressed in future work, e.g. by screening for antimicrobial properties of skin-associated bacterial isolates.},

abstract={Stone surfaces are extreme environments that support microbial life. This microbial growth occurs despite unfavourable conditions associated with stone including limited sources of nutrients and water, high pH and exposure to extreme variations in temperature, humidity and irradiation. These stone-dwelling microbes are often resistant to extreme environments including exposure to desiccation, heavy metals, UV and Gamma irradiation. Here, we report on the effects of climate and stone geochemistry on microbiomes of Roman stone ruins in North Africa. Stone microbiomes were dominated by Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria but were heavily impacted by climate variables that influenced water availability. Stone geochemistry also influenced community diversity, particularly through biologically available P, Mn and Zn. Functions associated with photosynthesis and UV protection were enriched in the metagenomes, indicating the significance of these functions for community survival on stones. Core members of the stone microbial communities were also identified and included Geodermatophilaceae, Rubrobacter, Sphingomonas and others. Our research has helped to expand the understanding of stone microbial community structure and functional capacity within the context of varying climates, geochemical properties and stone conditions.},
