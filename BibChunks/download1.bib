abstract={Natural microbiota plays an essential role in flavor compounds used in traditional food fermentation; however, the fluctuation in natural microbiota results in inconsistency in food quality. Thus, it is critical to reveal the core microbiota for flavor compound production and to construct a synthetic core microbiota for use in constant food fermentation. Here, we reveal the core microbiota based on their flavor production and cooccurrence performance, using Chinese light-aroma-type liquor as a model system. Five genera, Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, Pichia, Geotrichum, and Candida, were identified to be the core microbiota. The synthetic core microbiota of these five genera presented a reproducible dynamic profile similar to that in the natural microbiota. A Monte Carlo test showed that the effects of five environmental factors (lactic acid, ethanol, and acetic acid contents, moisture, and pH) on the synthetic microbiota distribution were highly significant (P < 0.01), similar to those effects on a natural fermentation system. In addition, 77.27% of the flavor compounds produced by the synthetic core microbiota showed a similar dynamic profile (rho > 0) with that in the natural liquor fermentation process, and the flavor profile presented a similar composition. It indicated that the synthetic core microbiota is efficient for reproducible flavor metabolism. This work established a method for identifying core microbiota and constructing a synthetic microbiota for reproducible flavor compounds. This work is of great significance for the tractable and constant production of various fermented foods.IMPORTANCE The transformation from natural fermentation to synthetic fermentation is essential in constructing a constant food fermentation process, which is the premise for stably making high-quality food. According to flavor-producing and cooccurring functions in dominant microbes, we provided a system-level approach to identify the core microbiota in Chinese light-aroma-type liquor fermentation. In addition, we successfully constructed a synthetic core microbiota to simulate the microbial community succession and flavor compound production in the in vitro system. The constructed synthetic core microbiota could not only facilitate a mechanistic understanding of the structure and function of the microbiota but also be beneficial for constructing a tractable and reproducible food fermentation process.},

abstract={Microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract of animals play vital roles in food digestion, homeostasis and immune response regulation. Globally, there are 33,700 fish species, representing almost half of all vertebrate diversity and a wide range of physiologies, ecologies and life histories. To investigate gut microbiomes with high coverage, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing with samples of 20 common marine fish. The fish gut microbiome is a remarkably simple community with low microbial diversity (a maximum of 300 amplicon sequence variants only) and has up to 70% of unknown species in some fish species. The gut microbial community structure was significantly shaped by the combined influence of host-associated factors, including the fish taxon (p < 0.001, R(2) = 0.16, omega(2) = 0.04), feeding habit (p < 0.001, R(2) = 0.06, omega(2) = 0.02) and trophic level (p < 0.01, R(2) = 0.04, omega(2) = 0.01), although the influence was subtle with a small effect size. The core gut microbiomes of different feeding habits was also previously discovered in animal-associated and corresponding habitat samples. Certain energy metabolism pathways were enriched in herbivore/omnivore and zooplanktivore/zoobenthivore fishes, whereas lipid metabolism and glycan metabolism were enriched in zoobenthivore/piscivore fishes. Moreover, substantial taxonomic variability was found between the gut microbiomes of fish and animals, indicated by their low degree of shared microbiota. The data and observations reported herein pave the way for further investigations on the coevolution of fish gut microbiomes and their hosts, the physiological functions of gut microorganisms, and the development of probiotics for improving the nutrition and health of aquaculture fish species.},

abstract={This study describes the dechlorination ability of acclimated biomass, the high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of such microorganisms, and the analysis of their community structure in relation to special functions. Two types of acclimated biomass (AB-1 and AB-2) were obtained via different acclimated treatment processes and were used to degrade 2,4,6trichlorophenol. The degradation pathway and characteristics of trichlorophenol degradation were different between the two groups. AB-1 degraded trichlorophenol only to 4-chlorophenol. AB-2 completely dechlorinated trichlorophenol and opened the benzene ring. The 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing method was employed to examine the microbial diversity. It was found that the microbial richness and diversity of AB-1 were higher than those of AB-2. Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were 2.7-fold and 4.3-fold more abundant, respectively, in AB-1 than in AB-2. Dechlorination bacteria in AB-1 mainly included Desulfobulbus, Desulfovibrio, Dechloromonas, and Geobacter. The above-mentioned bacteria were less abundant in AB-2, but the abundance of Desulfomicrobium was twofold higher in AB-2 than in AB-1. The two types of acclimated biomass contained different hydrogen (H2)-producing bacteria. AB-2 showed higher abundance and diversity of hydrogen-producing bacteria. There was no Ignavibacteriae in AB-1, whereas its abundance in AB-2 was 8.4%. In this biomass, Ignavibacteriae was responsible for opening of the benzene ring. This study indicates that the abundance and diversity of microorganisms are not necessarily beneficial to the formation of a functional dechlorinating community. The H2-producing bacteria (which showed greater abundance and diversity) and Ignavibacterium were assumed to be core functional populations that gave AB-2 stronger dechlorination and phenol-degradation abilities. Control of lower oxidation reduction potential (Eh) and higher temperatures by means of fresh aerobic activated sludge as the starting microbial group, caused rapid complete dechlorination of 2,4,6trichlorophenol and benzene ring opening.},

abstract={This study investigated the impact of different dietary ingredients, with different protein/lipid sources, on midgut and faeces bacteria community structures just before feeding and 3 h after feeding a single meal to individual rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Fish were kept in experimental rearing facilities and fed ad libitum twice daily for 5 weeks. Fish were fed three different commercial diets, which contained variations of high or low marine fishmeal/fish oil content. DNA was extracted from midgut and faeces samples for analysis of their bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity by targeting the V3-V4 region with 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 332 unique bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were revealed in all samples. However, each sample was dominated (>80% relative abundance) by 2-14 OTUs, with the single most dominant OTU having >30% dominance, indicating that only a few bacteria were fundamental in terms of relative abundance in each treatment. Fifteen OTUs occurred in all samples (core microbiota). The majority of these OTUs belonged to the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes or Tenericutes, and were associated with other animal gut environments. The faecal material and the midgut samples had few overlaps in their shared OTUs. A postprandial response in the gut bacterial community structure 3 h after feeding highlights how dietary stimulation induces structural changes in the microbiota profiles in the established gut bacteria. This study showed that feeding O. mykiss different diets and even single meals lead to perturbations in the established gut bacteria of O. mykiss.},

abstract={Intestinal inflammation can cause impaired epithelial barrier function and disrupt immune homeostasis, which increases the risks of developing many highly fatal diseases. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 causes intestinal infections worldwide and is a major pathogen that induces intestinal inflammation. Various antibacterial peptides have been described as having the potential to suppress and treat pathogen-induced intestinal inflammation. Cecropin A (1-8)-LL37 (17-30) (C-L), a novel hybrid peptide designed in our laboratory that combines the active center of C with the core functional region of L, shows superior antibacterial properties and minimized cytotoxicity compared to its parental peptides. Herein, to examine whether C-L could inhibit pathogen-induced intestinal inflammation, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of C-L in EHEC O157:H7-infected mice. C-L treatment improved the microbiota composition and microbial community balance in mouse intestines. The hybrid peptide exhibited improved anti-inflammatory effects than did the antibiotic, enrofloxacin. Hybrid peptide treated infected mice demonstrated reduced clinical signs of inflammation, reduced weight loss, reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)], reduced apoptosis, and reduced markers of jejunal epithelial barrier function. The peptide also affected the MyD88-nuclear factor kappaB signaling pathway, thereby modulating inflammatory responses upon EHEC stimulation. Collectively, these findings suggest that the novel hybrid peptide C-L could be developed into a new anti-inflammatory agent for use in animals or humans.},
