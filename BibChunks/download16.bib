abstract={Direct evidence in humans for the impact of the microbiome on nutrient absorption is lacking. We conducted an extended inpatient study using two interventions that we hypothesized would alter the gut microbiome and nutrient absorption. In each, stool calorie loss, a direct proxy of nutrient absorption, was measured. The first phase was a randomized cross-over dietary intervention in which all participants underwent in random order 3 d of over- and underfeeding. The second was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacologic intervention using oral vancomycin or matching placebo (NCT02037295). Twenty-seven volunteers (17 men and 10 women, age 35.1 +/- 7.3, BMI 32.3 +/- 8.0), who were healthy other than having impaired glucose tolerance and obesity, were enrolled and 25 completed the entire trial. The primary endpoints were the effects of dietary and pharmacological intervention on stool calorie loss. We hypothesized that stool calories expressed as percentage of caloric intake would increase with underfeeding compared with overfeeding and increase during oral vancomycin treatment. Both primary endpoints were met. Greater stool calorie loss was observed during underfeeding relative to overfeeding and during vancomycin treatment compared with placebo. Key secondary endpoints were to evaluate the changes in gut microbial community structure as evidenced by amplicon sequencing and metagenomics. We observed only a modest perturbation of gut microbial community structure with under- versus overfeeding but a more widespread change in community structure with reduced diversity with oral vancomycin. Increase in Akkermansia muciniphila was common to both interventions that resulted in greater stool calorie loss. These results indicate that nutrient absorption is sensitive to environmental perturbations and support the translational relevance of preclinical models demonstrating a possible causal role for the gut microbiome in dietary energy harvest.},

abstract={The cutaneous skin microbiome is host to a vast ensemble of resident microbes that provide essential capabilities including protection of skin barrier integrity and modulation of the host immune response. Cutaneous burn-injury promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus control participants. Temporal changes of the skin microbiome during health and cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial shift relates to community function in the collective metagenome remain elusive. Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the microbiota, reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core microbiome that is distinct at the genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).},

abstract={The main goal of modern microbial ecology is to determine the key factors influencing the global diversity of microorganisms. Because of their complexity, soil communities are largely underexplored in this context. We studied soil genesis (combination of various soil-forming processes, specific to a particular soil type) that is driven by microbial activity. To investigate the interrelation between soil type and microbial diversity, we analyzed six soil types that are common in Russia, the Crimea, and Kazakhstan using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. Soils of different types varied in the taxonomic composition of microbial communities. Their core microbiomes comprised 47 taxa within the orders Solirubrobacteriales and Hyphomicrobiaceae and the Gaiellaceae family. Two species from Bradyrhizobiaceae and Solirubrobactriaceae were present in all samples, whereas most other taxa were soil-type specific. Multiple resampling analysis revealed that two random soil samples from the same soil type shared more taxa than two samples from different types. The differences in community composition were mostly affected by the variation in pH values and exchangeable potassium content. The results show that data on the soil microbiome could be used for soil identification and clarification of their taxonomic position.},

These plants adopted A2/O, A/O and oxidation ditch processes and were active in the treatment of different types and sources of wastewater, some domestic and others industrial. The bacterial community composition was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing technology. The correlations among microbial community structure, dominant microbes and process performance were investigated. Seasonal variation had a stronger impact on the AS bacterial community than any variation within different wastewater treatment system. Facing seasonal variation, the bacterial community within the oxidation ditch process remained more stable those in either the A2/O or A/O processes. The core genera in domestic wastewater treatment systems were Nitrospira, Caldilineaceae, Pseudomonas and Lactococcus. The core genera in the textile dyeing and fine chemical industrial wastewater treatment systems were Nitrospira, Thauera and Thiobacillus.},

abstract={Salmonella colonization and infection in production animals such as pigs are a cause for concern from a public health perspective. Variations in susceptibility to natural infection may be influenced by the intestinal microbiota. Using 16S rRNA compositional sequencing, we characterized the fecal microbiome of 15 weaned pigs naturally infected with Salmonella at 18, 33, and 45 days postweaning. Dissimilarities in microbiota composition were analyzed in relation to Salmonella infection status (infected, not infected), serological status, and shedding pattern (nonshedders, single-point shedders, intermittent-persistent shedders). Global microbiota composition was associated with the infection outcome based on serological analysis. Greater richness within the microbiota postweaning was linked to pigs being seronegative at the end of the study at 11 weeks of age. Members of the Clostridia, such as Blautia, Roseburia, and Anaerovibrio, were more abundant and part of the core microbiome in nonshedder pigs. Cellulolytic microbiota (Ruminococcus and Prevotella) were also more abundant in noninfected pigs during the weaning and growing stages. Microbial profiling also revealed that infected pigs had a higher abundance of Lactobacillus and Oscillospira, the latter also being part of the core microbiome of intermittent-persistent shedders. These findings suggest that a lack of microbiome maturation and greater proportions of microorganisms associated with suckling increase susceptibility to infection. In addition, the persistence of Salmonella shedding may be associated with an enrichment of pathobionts such as Anaerobiospirillum. Overall, these results suggest that there may be merit in manipulating certain taxa within the porcine intestinal microbial community to increase disease resistance against Salmonella in pigs. IMPORTANCE Salmonella is a global threat for public health, and pork is one of the main sources of human salmonellosis. However, the complex epidemiology of the infection limits current control strategies aimed at reducing the prevalence of this infection in pigs. The present study analyzes for the first time the impact of the gut microbiota in Salmonella infection in pigs and its shedding pattern in naturally infected growing pigs. Microbiome (16S rRNA amplicon) analysis reveals that maturation of the gut microbiome could be a key consideration with respect to limiting the infection and shedding of Salmonella in pigs. Indeed, seronegative animals had higher richness of the gut microbiota early after weaning, and uninfected pigs had higher abundance of strict anaerobes from the class Clostridia, results which demonstrate that a fast transition from the suckling microbiota to a postweaning microbiota could be crucial with respect to protecting the animals.},
