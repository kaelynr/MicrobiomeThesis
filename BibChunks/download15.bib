abstract={Grassland afforestation dramatically affects the abiotic, biotic, and ecological function properties of the original ecosystems. Interference from afforestation might disrupt the stasis of soil physicochemical properties and the dynamic balance of microbiota. Some studies have suggested low sensitivity of soil properties and bacterial community to afforestation, but the apparent lack of a significant relationship is probably due to the confounding effects of the generalist habitat and rare bacterial communities. In this study, soil chemical and prokaryotic properties in a 30-year-old Mongolia pine (Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv.) afforested region and adjacent grassland in Inner Mongolia were classified and quantified. Our results indicate that the high richness of rare microbes accounts for the alpha-diversity of the soil microbiome. Few OTUs of generalist (core bacteria) and habitat-specialist bacteria are present. However, the high abundance of this small number of OTUs governs the beta-diversity of the grassland and afforested land bacterial communities. Afforestation has changed the soil chemical properties, thus indirectly affecting the soil bacterial composition rather than richness. The contents of soil P, Ca(2+), and Fe(3+) account for differentially abundant OTUs such as Planctomycetes and subsequent changes in the ecologically functional potential of soil bacterial communities due to grassland afforestation. We conclude that grassland afforestation has changed the chemical properties and composition of the soil and ecological functions of the soil bacterial community and that these effects of afforestation on the microbiome have been modulated by changes in soil chemical properties.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, most attention to Chinese Cordyceps-associated endogenous microorganism was focused on the fungal community that creates critical bioactive components. Bacterial community associated with Chinese Cordyceps has been previously described; however, most studies were only presenting direct comparisons in the Chinese Cordyceps and its microenvironments. In the current study, our objectives were to reveal the bacterial community structure composition and predict their function. RESULTS: We collected samples of Chinese Cordyceps from five sites located in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and used a high throughput sequencing method to compare Chinese Cordyceps-associated bacterial community composition and diversity quantitatively across sites. The results indicated that for the Chinese Cordyceps-associated bacterial community there is no single core microbiome, which was dominated by the both Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Predictive functional profiling suggested a location specific function pattern for Chinese Cordyceps and bacteria in the external mycelial cortices involved in the biosynthesis of active constituents. CONCLUSIONS: This study is firstly used high throughput sequencing method to compare the bacterial communities inhabiting Chinese Cordyceps and its microhabitat and to reveal composition functional capabilities of the bacteria, which will accelerate the study of the functions of bacterial communities in the micro-ecological system of Chinese Cordyceps.},

abstract={Dairy foods are complex ecosystems composed of microorganisms from different origins that can affect flavor and safety of final products. The objective of this paper is to assess the in-house microbiota of two Brazilian dairies and to discuss the possible implications of the taxa determined for food protection. In total, 27 samples from dairies were cultured in selective (Baird Parker, de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe) and non-selective (Brain Heart Infusion) media, and the isolates were identified by Sanger sequencing. Moreover, metagenomic DNA was directly extracted from samples and the structure of the bacterial community was determined by massive DNA sequencing followed by bioinformatics analyses. The results showed the majority of isolates belonged to the group of lactic acid bacteria, but Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcacceae, Bacillaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Moraxellaceae were also detected. From the reads obtained in metataxonomics analyses, a heatmap was constructed and the top 20 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) were determined. Besides, 12 most prevalent bacterial taxa were assigned to the core microbiota of the dairies evaluated, which included Thiomonas thermosulfata, Alkalibacillus salilacus, Pseudomonas clemancea, Erythrobacter aquimans, Tetragenococcus doogicus, Macrococcus brunensis, Pseudomonas ludensis, Streptococcus dentinousetti, Serratia entomophila, Vagococcus teuberi, Lactococcus fujiensis and Tolumonas auensis. In conclusion, the results reveal the presence of bacteria that may be related to spoilage and also foodborne diseases, in microbial niches that also present rare taxa, highlighting the importance to consider culture-independent results to evaluate and improve food safety.},

abstract={The variation and taxonomic diversity among mammalian gut microbiomes raises several questions about the factors that contribute to the rates and patterns of change in these microbial communities. By comparing the microbiome compositions of 112 species representing 14 mammalian orders, we assessed how host and ecological factors contribute to microbiome diversification. Except in rare cases, the same bacterial phyla predominate in mammalian gut microbiomes, and there has been some convergence of microbiome compositions according to dietary category across all mammalians lineages except Chiropterans (bats), which possess high proportions of Proteobacteria and tend to be most similar to one another regardless of diet. At lower taxonomic ranks (families, genera, 97% OTUs), bacteria are more likely to be associated with a particular mammalian lineage than with a particular dietary category, resulting in a strong phylogenetic signal in the degree to which microbiomes diverge. Despite different physiologies, the gut microbiomes of several mammalian lineages have diverged at roughly the same rate over the past 75 million years; however, the gut microbiomes of Cetartiodactyla (ruminants, whales, hippopotami) have evolved much faster and those of Chiropterans much slower. Contrary to expectations, the number of dietary transitions within a lineage does not influence rates of microbiome divergence, but instead, some of the most dramatic changes are associated with the loss of bacterial taxa, such as those accompanying the transition from terrestrial to marine lifestyles and the evolution of hominids.},

abstract={Fresh vegetables harbor diverse bacterial populations on their surfaces. However, information on this microbiota is limited to a few types of fresh vegetables, and little is known about how it varies with geography and host condition. Here, we analyzed bacterial communities on the floret surfaces of 66 field-grown broccoli collected from 22 farms in four farming regions of Jeju Island, South Korea, using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, and we determined their relationships to farming region and host-associated factors. Geographic variations in bacterial community composition and diversity were observed among farming regions, which partly reflected their relative humidity and insolation. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes; core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae contributed to the community differences. Bacterial community composition differed between immature and mature samples, with mature samples harboring higher bacterial diversity. In comparison with communities on other types of fresh vegetables and fruits, bacterial communities on broccoli florets were unique but more similar to those of ground vegetables than to those of tree fruits/vegetables. This study presents novel data on the variability of floret-associated bacterial populations of field-grown broccoli relative to environmental and host-associated factors.IMPORTANCE Fresh vegetables harbor diverse and complex bacterial populations on their surfaces. These indigenous bacteria may play a role in human and crop health; however, the diversity and variability of bacterial communities on fresh vegetables require further study. A popular crop of leafy vegetables, broccoli, is of great agricultural and industrial importance. This study provides a detailed description of the bacterial community composition and diversity on the surfaces of broccoli florets. The variability of bacterial communities is associated with the geographic location of farming sites and is affected by host growth and health. The bacterial communities specific to broccoli were identified and showed greater similarity to those found on ground vegetables than to those found on tree fruits/vegetables. This study presents novel data on the impact of environmental and host-associated conditions on the variability of floret-associated bacterial populations present on field-grown broccoli.},
