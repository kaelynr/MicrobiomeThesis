abstract={This study addressed the selection of the rhizospheric microbial community from the bulk soil reservoir under agricultural management of soybean in Amazon forest soils. We used a shotgun metagenomics approach to investigate the taxonomic and functional diversities of microbial communities in the bulk soil and in the rhizosphere of soybean plants and tested the validity of neutral and niche theories to explain the rhizosphere community assembly processes. Our results showed a clear selection at both taxonomic and functional levels operating in the assembly of the soybean rhizosphere community. The taxonomic analysis revealed that the rhizosphere community is a subset of the bulk soil community. Species abundance in rhizosphere fits the log-normal distribution model, which is an indicator of the occurrence of niche-based processes. In addition, the data indicate that the rhizosphere community is selected based on functional cores related to the metabolisms of nitrogen, iron, phosphorus and potassium, which are related to benefits to the plant, such as growth promotion and nutrition. The network analysis including bacterial groups and functions was less complex in rhizosphere, suggesting the specialization of some specific metabolic pathways. We conclude that the assembly of the microbial community in the rhizosphere is based on niche-based processes as a result of the selection power of the plant and other environmental factors.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Although the significance of the human vaginal microbiome for health and disease is increasingly acknowledged, there is paucity of data on the differences in the composition of the vaginal microbiome upon infection with different sexually transmitted pathogens. METHOD: The composition of the vaginal bacterial community of women with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV, N = 18) was compared to that of women with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT, N = 14), and to that of controls (N = 21) (women negative for TV, CT and bacterial vaginosis). The vaginal bacterial composition was determined using high throughput sequencing with the Ion 16S metagenomics kit of the variable regions 2, 4 and 8 of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene from the vaginal swab DNA extract of the women. QIIME and R package "Phyloseq" were used to assess the alpha- and beta-diversity and absolute abundance of the 16S rRNA gene per sample in the three groups. Differences in taxa at various levels were determined using the independent T-test. RESULTS: A total of 545 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in all the three groups of which 488 occurred in all three groups (core OTUs). Bacterial alpha-diversity, by both Simpson's and Shannon's indices, was significantly higher, (p = 0.056) and (p = 0.001) respectively, among women with either TV or CT than among controls (mean alpha-diversity TV-infected > CT-infected > Controls). At the genus level, women infected with TV had a significantly (p < 0.01) higher abundance of Parvimonas and Prevotella species compared to both controls and CT-infected women, whereas women infected with CT had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher abundance of Anaerococcus, Collinsella, Corynebacterium and Dialister. CONCLUSION: The vaginal microbiomes of TV and CT-infected women were markedly different from each other and from women without TV and CT. Future studies should determine whether the altered microbiomes are merely markers of disease, or whether they actively contribute to the pathology of the two genital infections.},

abstract={We investigated the effect of repeated subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) challenges on the pH, fermentative function, and bacterial community in the rumen. Four rumen-cannulated Holstein bulls were fed a high-forage diet for 7 d (HF period) followed by a high-grain diet for 7 d (HG period). Four SARA challenges were carried out consecutively (first, second, third, and fourth challenges). The ruminal pH was measured continuously during the experiment, and rumen fluid samples during the first to fourth challenges were collected at 0800, 1400, and 2000 h on the last days of each feeding period for analysis; volatile fatty acid components, NH3-N, and lactic acid concentrations were measured. Bacterial community structure was analyzed at 0800 h during the first and fourth challenges on the last days of each period. The 24-h mean ruminal pH was decreased during the transition from high-forage to high-grain diet and tended to differ between the HF and HG periods. During the HG period, ruminal pH <5.6 was maintained for a longer period in the first and second challenges (350 and 405 min/d, respectively) than in the third and fourth challenges (both 120 min/d). A marked increase in total volatile fatty acid and NH3-N concentrations during the HG period was observed in the later challenges. In addition, lower and higher proportions of acetic and butyric acids, respectively, were observed during the HG period than during the HF period. A total of 37 core bacterial genera were found in all samples; however, the relative abundance of several genera differed significantly between the HF and HG periods (Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, and Oscillibacter) and between the first and fourth challenges (Eubacterium and unclassified Clostridiaceae). During the HG period, lower relative abundances of Prevotella, Eubacterium, and Oscillibacter and higher relative abundance of Ruminococcus were detected compared with during the HF period. The relative abundances of Eubacterium and unclassified Clostridiaceae were lower in the first challenge than in the fourth challenge. Bacterial diversity was greater during the HF period than during the HG period and was greater during the fourth challenge than during the first challenge. Interestingly, diversity indices during the HG period of the fourth challenge were higher than those during the HF period of the first challenge. These results suggested that rumen fermentation in Holstein cattle can adapt to repeated SARA challenges by minimizing the adverse changes in ruminal pH. Moreover, the composition and diversity of the ruminal bacterial community may be affected by ruminal pH and vice versa.},

abstract={Although seagrasses are economically and ecologically critical species, little is known about their blade surface microbial communities and how these communities relate to the plant host. To determine microbial community composition and diversity on seagrass blade surfaces and in the surrounding seawater,16S rRNA gene sequencing (iTag) was used for samples collected at five sites along a gradient of freshwater input in the northern Gulf of Mexico on three separate sampling dates. Additionally, seagrass surveys were performed and environmental parameters were measured to characterize host characteristics and the abiotic conditions at each site. Results showed that Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) blades hosted unique microbial communities that were distinct in composition and diversity from the water column. Environmental conditions, including water depth, salinity, and temperature, influenced community structure as blade surface microbial communities varied among sites and sampling dates in correlation with changes in environmental parameters. Microbial community composition also correlated with seagrass host characteristics, including growth rates and blade nutrient composition. There is some evidence for a core community for T. testudinum as 21 microorganisms from five phyla (Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes) were present in all blade surface samples. This study provides new insights and understanding of the processes that influence the structure of marine phyllosphere communities, how these microbial communities relate to their host, and their role as a part of the seagrass holobiont, which is an important contribution given the current decline of seagrass coverage worldwide.},

title={Seasonal, spatial, and maternal effects on gut microbiome in wild red squirrels},
journal={NA},
journal_abbreviated={NA},
source={Microbiome},
volume={5},
issue={1},
pages={NA},
abstract={Background: Our understanding of gut microbiota has been limited primarily to findings from human and laboratory animals, but what shapes the gut microbiota in nature remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we conducted a comprehensive study of gut microbiota of a well-studied North American red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) population. Red squirrels are territorial, solitary, and live in a highly seasonal environment and therefore represent a very attractive system to study factors that drive the temporal and spatial dynamics of gut microbiota. Result: For the first time, this study revealed significant spatial patterns of gut microbiota within a host population, suggesting limited dispersal could play a role in shaping and maintaining the structure of gut microbial communities. We also found a remarkable seasonal rhythm in red squirrel's gut microbial composition manifested by a tradeoff between relative abundance of two genera Oscillospira and Corpococcus and clearly associated with seasonal variation in diet availability. Our results show that in nature, environmental factors exert a much stronger influence on gut microbiota than host-associated factors including age and sex. Despite strong environmental effects, we found clear evidence of individuality and maternal effects, but host genetics did not seem to be a significant driver of the gut microbial communities in red squirrels. Conclusion: Taken together, the results of this study emphasize the importance of external ecological factors rather than host attributes in driving temporal and spatial patterns of gut microbiota in natural environment.},
