abstract={The structure of microbial communities in a typical Italian-style salami, including bacterial and fungal diversity, was investigated by high-throughput sequencing technology. A total of 6 phyla, 7 classes, 19 orders, 20 families and 28 genera were obtained from 16S rDNA sequences, and a total of 2 phyla, 4 classes, 4 orders, 5 families, 10 genera and 12 Species were obtained from 18S rDNA sequences. The core microbiota was composed of Staphylococcaceae, representing up to 97.52% of the total 16S rRNA, and Penicillium digitatum, accounting for 99.74% of the total classified 18S rRNA. Lactobacillales and Saccharomycetales were detected with a quite low proportion of 1.71 and 0.007%, respectively. This study contributes to the knowledge of the microbial diversity involved in salami and presents high-throughput sequencing as a useful tool to evaluate microbial diversity and monitor the food-borne pathogens in fermented sausage.},

abstract={Background: A functional interplay between BAs and microbial composition in gut is a well-documented phenomenon. In bile, this phenomenon is far less studied, and with this report, we describe the interactions between the BAs and microbiota in this complex biological matrix. Methodology. Thirty-seven gallstone disease patients of which twenty-one with Opisthorchis felineus infection were enrolled in the study. The bile samples were obtained during laparoscopic cholecystectomy for gallstone disease operative treatment. Common bile acid composition was measured by LC-MS/MS. Gallbladder microbiota were previously analyzed with 16S rRNA gene sequencing on Illumina MiSeq platform. The associations between bile acid composition and microbiota were analyzed. Results: Bile acid signature and Opisthorchis felineus infection status exert influence on beta-diversity of bile microbial community. Direct correlations were found between taurocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid concentrations, and alpha-diversity of bile microbiota. Taurocholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid both show positive associations with the presence of Chitinophagaceae family, Microbacterium and Lutibacterium genera, and Prevotella intermedia. Also, direct associations were identified for taurocholic acid concentration and the presence of Actinomycetales and Bacteroidales orders, Lautropia genus, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and Haemophilus parainfluenzae as well as for taurochenodeoxycholic acid and Acetobacteraceae family and Sphingomonas genus. There were no differences in bile acid concentrations between O. felineus-infected and noninfected patients. Conclusions/Significance. Associations between diversity, taxonomic profile of bile microbiota, and bile acid levels were evidenced in patients with cholelithiasis. Increase of taurochenodeoxycholic acid and taurocholic acid concentration correlates with bile microbiota alpha-diversity and appearance of opportunistic pathogens.},

abstract={Proteins and carbohydrates have profound impacts on the ecology of gut microbiota, but disentangling the single and interactive effects of different dietary constituents is challenging. Here, we used a multidimensional approach, the Geometric Framework, to study the interactions between nutrition and bacterial abundances with respect to protein and carbohydrate intakes in field cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus. Our study revealed that species richness decreased as crickets consumed more macronutrients, and species evenness peaked at high intake of protein-rich diets. Sex and protein:carbohydrate (P:C) ratios in diets were the primary factors influencing the gut bacterial community, but most of the microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were significantly different between males and females were present in low abundance. In contrast, protein intake had a greater influence than carbohydrate consumption on the relative abundances of the core bacterial taxa, as an increase in dietary protein availability could remove the growth constraint imposed by limited nitrogen. Taken together, the use of the Geometric Framework provides a deeper insight into how nutritional intakes influence the relative abundances of gut microbes, and could be a useful tool to integrate the study of gut microbiome and fitness traits in a host.},

abstract={BACKGROUND: Holobionts have a digestive microbiota with catabolic abilities allowing the degradation of complex dietary compounds for the host. In terrestrial herbivores, the digestive microbiota is known to degrade complex polysaccharides from land plants while in marine herbivores, the digestive microbiota is poorly characterized. Most of the latter are generalists and consume red, green, and brown macroalgae, three distinct lineages characterized by a specific composition in complex polysaccharides, which represent half of their biomass. Subsequently, each macroalga features a specific epiphytic microbiota, and the digestive microbiota of marine herbivores is expected to vary with a monospecific algal diet. We investigated the effect of four monospecific diets (Palmaria palmata, Ulva lactuca, Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) on the composition and specificity of the digestive microbiota of a generalist marine herbivore, the abalone, farmed in a temperate coastal area over a year. The microbiota from the abalone digestive gland was sampled every 2 months and explored using metabarcoding. RESULTS: Diversity and multivariate analyses showed that patterns of the microbiota were significantly linked to seasonal variations of contextual parameters but not directly to a specific algal diet. Three core genera: Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio constantly dominated the microbiota in the abalone digestive gland. Additionally, a less abundant and diet-specific core microbiota featured genera representing aerobic primary degraders of algal polysaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the establishment of a persistent core microbiota in the digestive gland of the abalone since its juvenile state and the presence of a less abundant and diet-specific core community. While composed of different microbial taxa compared to terrestrial herbivores, the digestive gland constitutes a particular niche in the abalone holobiont, where bacteria (i) may cooperate to degrade algal polysaccharides to products assimilable by the host or (ii) may have acquired these functions through gene transfer from the aerobic algal microbiota.},

abstract={Bees acquire carbohydrates from nectar and lipids; and amino acids from pollen, which also contains polysaccharides including cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. These potential energy sources could be degraded and fermented through microbial enzymatic activity, resulting in short chain fatty acids available to hosts. However, the contributions of individual microbiota members to polysaccharide digestion have remained unclear. Through analysis of bacterial isolate genomes and a metagenome of the honey bee gut microbiota, we identify that Bifidobacterium and Gilliamella are the principal degraders of hemicellulose and pectin. Both Bifidobacterium and Gilliamella show extensive strain-level diversity in gene repertoires linked to polysaccharide digestion. Strains from honey bees possess more such genes than strains from bumble bees. In Bifidobacterium, genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes are colocated within loci devoted to polysaccharide utilization, as in Bacteroides from the human gut. Carbohydrate-active enzyme-encoding gene expressions are up-regulated in response to particular hemicelluloses both in vitro and in vivo. Metabolomic analyses document that bees experimentally colonized by different strains generate distinctive gut metabolomic profiles, with enrichment for specific monosaccharides, corresponding to predictions from genomic data. The other 3 core gut species clusters (Snodgrassella and 2 Lactobacillus clusters) possess few or no genes for polysaccharide digestion. Together, these findings indicate that strain composition within individual hosts determines the metabolic capabilities and potentially affects host nutrition. Furthermore, the niche specialization revealed by our study may promote overall community stability in the gut microbiomes of bees.},
