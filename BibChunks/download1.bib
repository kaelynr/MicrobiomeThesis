abstract={Bacterial biofilm infections often involve aggregates of bacteria heterogeneously distributed throughout a tissue or on a surface (such as an implanted medical device). Identification of a biofilm infection requires direct visualization via microscopy, followed by characterization of the microbial community by culturing or sequencing-based approaches. A sample, therefore, must be divided prior to analysis, often leading to inconsistent results. We demonstrate a combined approach, using scanning electron microscopy and next-generation shotgun sequencing, to visually identify a biofilm and characterize the microbial community, without dividing the sample. A clinical sample recovered from a patient following a dental root-filling procedure was prepared and visualized by scanning electron microscopy. DNA was then extracted from the sample several years later and analyzed by shotgun sequencing. The method was subsequently validated on in vitro cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm. Between 19 and 21 different genera and species were identified in the clinical sample with an estimated relative abundance greater than 1% by two different estimation approaches. Only eight genera identified were not associated with endodontic infections. This provides a proof-of-concept for a dual, microscopy and sequencing-based approach to identify and characterize bacterial biofilms, which could also easily be implemented in other scientific fields.},

abstract={Since the last few decades, the promiscuous and uncontrolled use of plastics led to the accumulation of millions of tons of plastic waste in the terrestrial and marine environment. It elevated the risk of environmental pollution and climate change. The concern arises more due to the reckless and unscientific disposal of plastics containing high molecular weight polymers, viz., polystyrene, polyamide, polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyurethane, and polyethylene, etc. which are very difficult to degrade. Thus, the focus is now paid to search for efficient, eco-friendly, low-cost waste management technology. Of them, degradation of non-degradable synthetic polymer using diverse microbial agents, viz., bacteria, fungi, and other extremophiles become an emerging option. So far, very few microbial agents and their secreted enzymes have been identified and characterized for plastic degradation, but with low efficiency. It might be due to the predominance of uncultured microbial species, which consequently remain unexplored from the respective plastic degrading milieu. To overcome this problem, metagenomic analysis of microbial population engaged in the plastic biodegradation is advisable to decipher the microbial community structure and to predict their biodegradation potential in situ. Advancements in sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis allow the rapid metagenome screening that helps in the identification of total microbial community and also opens up the scope for mining genes or enzymes (hydrolases, laccase, etc.) engaged in polymer degradation. Further, the extraction of the core microbial population and their adaptation, fitness, and survivability can also be deciphered through comparative metagenomic study. It will help to engineer the microbial community and their metabolic activity to speed up the degradation process.},

abstract={Gut microbial communities are critical for the health of many insect species. However, little is known about how gut microbial communities respond to anthropogenic changes and how such changes affect host-pathogen interactions. In this study, we used deep sequencing to investigate and compare the composition of gut microbial communities within the midgut and ileum (both bacteria and fungi) in Bombus terrestris queens collected from natural (forest) and urbanized habitats. Additionally, we investigated whether the variation in gut microbial communities under each habitat affected the prevalence of two important bumblebee pathogens that have recently been associated with Bombus declines (Crithidia bombi and Nosema bombi). Microbial community composition differed strongly among habitat types, both for fungi and bacteria. Fungi were almost exclusively associated with bumblebee queens from the forest habitats, and were not commonly detected in bumblebee queens from the urban sites. Further, gut bacterial communities of urban B. terrestris specimens were strongly dominated by bee-specific core bacteria like Snodgrassella (Betaproteobacteria) and Gilliamella (Gammaproteobacteria), whereas specimens from the forest sites contained a huge fraction of environmental bacteria. Pathogen infection was very low in urban populations and infection by Nosema was only observed in specimens collected from forest habitats. No significant relationship was found between pathogen prevalence and microbial gut diversity. However, there was a significant and negative relationship between prevalence of Nosema and relative abundance of the core resident Snodgrassella, supporting its role in pathogen defense. Overall, our results indicate that land-use change may lead to different microbial gut communities in bumblebees, which may have implications for bumblebee health, survival and overall fitness.},

abstract={Sponges harbor characteristic microbiomes derived from symbiotic relationships shaping their lifestyle and survival. Haliclona fulva is encrusting marine sponge species dwelling in coralligenous accretions or semidark caves of the Mediterranean Sea and the near Atlantic Ocean. In this work, we characterized the abundance and core microbial community composition found in specimens of H. fulva by means of electron microscopy and 16S amplicon Illumina sequencing. We provide evidence of its low microbial abundance (LMA) nature. We found that the H. fulva core microbiome is dominated by sequences belonging to the orders Nitrosomonadales and Cenarchaeales. Seventy percent of the reads assigned to these phylotypes grouped in a very small number of high-frequency operational taxonomic units, representing niche-specific species Cenarchaeum symbiosum and uncultured Betaproteobacteria HF1, a new eubacterial ribotype variant found in H. fulva. The microbial composition of H. fulva is quite distinct from those reported in sponge species of the same Haliclona genus. We also detected evidence of an excretion/capturing loop between these abundant microorganisms and planktonic microbes by analyzing shifts in seawater planktonic microbial content exposed to healthy sponge specimens maintained in aquaria. Our results suggest that horizontal transmission is very likely the main mechanism for symbionts' acquisition by H. fulva. So far, this is the first shallow water sponge species harboring such a specific and predominant assemblage composed of these eubacterial and archaeal ribotypes. Our data suggests that this symbiotic relationship is very stable over time, indicating that the identified core microbial symbionts may play key roles in the holobiont functioning.},

abstract={Generally speaking, fish intestinal microbiota is easily affected by food or water environment, and it may be dynamically changed along with body growth. However, it remains unclear whether fish gut microbiota can be affected under any conditions. In the present study, we focused on cultured larval turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and tracked its artificial breeding process from eggs to larvae in two farms located in different regions of China. Through continuous sampling, we analyzed and compared characteristics of intestinal microbiota in turbot larvae and its correlation with the bacteria in water and food at different developmental stages. The results showed that there was a steady group of microbiota in larval gut, and the highest relative abundance of strain was same between the two farms. This microbiota was established soon after hatching of fertilized eggs. Particularly, the structure of this microbiota was nearly not changeable afterward 3-4 months of development. The bacteria carried by fertilized eggs might play an important role during the formation of this microbiota. In conclusion, our findings suggested that there was a core microbiota represented by Lactococcus sp. in gut of artificially bred turbot larvae. The relative proportion of such strain in gut was higher than 30% at the initial stage of turbot life.},
