abstract={In this study, we hypothesized that sympatrically grown farmed fish, i.e. fish which experience similar environmental conditions and nutritionally similar diets, would have more convergent gut microbiota. Using a "common garden" approach, we identified the core microbiota and bacterial community structure differences between five fish species farmed in the same aquaculture site on the west coast of the Aegean Sea, Greece. The investigated individuals were at similar developmental stages and reared in adjacent (< 50 m) aquaculture cages; each cage had 15 kg fish m(-3). The diets were nutritionally similar to support optimal growth for each fish species. DNA from the midgut of 3-6 individuals per fish species was extracted and sequenced for the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA. Only 3.9% of the total 181 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared among all fish. Between 5 and 74 OTUs were unique to each fish species. Each of the investigated fish species had a distinct profile of dominant OTUs, i.e. cumulative relative abundance of >/= 80%. Co-occurrence network analysis for each fish species showed that all networks were strongly dominated by positive correlations between the abundances of their OTUs. However, each fish species had different network characteristics suggesting the differential significance of the OTUs in each of the five fish species midgut. The results of the present study may provide evidence that adult fish farmed in the Mediterranean Sea have a rather divergent and species-specific gut microbiota profile, which are shaped independently of the similar environmental conditions under which they grow.},

abstract={Sponge diversity has been reported to decrease from well-preserved to polluted environments, but whether diversity and intra-species variation of their associated microbiomes also change as function of environmental quality remains unknown. Our study aimed to assess whether microbiome composition and structure are related to the proliferation of some sponges and not others under degraded conditions. We characterized the most frequent sponges and their associated bacteria in two close areas (impacted and well-preserved) of Nha Trang Bay (Indo-Pacific). Sponge assemblages were richer and more diverse in the well-preserved reefs, but more abundant (individuals/m. transect) in the impacted environments, where two species (Clathria reinwardti and Amphimedon paraviridis) dominated. Sponge microbiomes from the polluted zones had, in general, lower bacterial diversity and core size and consequently, higher intra-species dispersion than microbiomes of sponges from the well-preserved environments. Microbial communities reflect the reduction of diversity and richness shown by their host sponges. In this sense, sponges with less complex and more variable microbiomes proliferate under degraded environmental conditions, following the ecological paradigm that negatively correlates community diversity and environmental degradation. Thereby, the diversity and structure of sponge microbiomes might indirectly determine the presence and proliferation of sponge species in certain habitats.},

abstract={1. The abundance and distribution of species tend to be linked, such that species declining in abundance often tend also to show declines in the number of sites they occupy, while species increasing in abundance tend also to be increasing in occupancy. Therefore, intraspecific abundance–occupancy relationships are commonly positive. 2. The intraspecific pattern is mirrored by more general positive interspecific abundance–occupancy relationships: widespread species tend to be abundant, and narrowly distributed species rare. 3. Here, we review recent research on these patterns based on the flora and fauna of the British Isles. We assess their generality, describe what is currently known about their structure, and summarize the results of tests of the several hypotheses proposed to explain their existence. 4. The positive form generally exhibited by abundance–occupancy relationships, intraspecific or interspecific, has consequences for several areas of applied ecology, including conservation, harvesting, biological invasions and biodiversity inventorying. These implications are discussed briefly.},

abstract={The impact of the starting inoculum on long-term anaerobic digestion performance, process functionality and microbial community composition remains unclear. To understand the impact of starting inoculum, active microbial communities from four different full-scale anaerobic digesters were each used to inoculate four continuous lab-scale anaerobic digesters, which were operated identically for 295 days. Digesters were operated at 15 days solid retention time, an organic loading rate of 1g COD Lr(-1) d(-1) (75:25 - cellulose:casein) and 37 degrees C. Results showed that long-term process performance, metabolic rates (hydrolytic, acetogenic, and methanogenic) and microbial community are independent of the inoculum source. Digesters process performance converged after 80 days, while metabolic rates and microbial communities converged after 120-145 days. The convergence of the different microbial communities towards a core-community proves that the deterministic factors (process operational conditions) were a stronger driver than the initial microbial community composition. Indeed, the core-community represented 72% of the relative abundance among the four digesters. Moreover, a number of positive correlations were observed between higher metabolic rates and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups. These correlations showed that both substrate consumers and suppliers trigger higher metabolic rates, expanding the knowledge of the nexus between microorganisms and functionality. Overall, these results support that deterministic factors control microbial communities in bioreactors independently of the inoculum source. Hence, it seems plausible that a desired microbial composition and functionality can be achieved by tuning process operational conditions.},

abstract={Antarctic cryoconite holes (CHs) are mostly perennially ice-lidded and sediment-filled depressions that constitute important features on glaciers and ice sheets. Once being hydrologically connected, these microbially dominated mini-ecosystems provide nutrients and biota for downstream environments. For example, the East Antarctic Anuchin Glacier gradually melts into the adjacent perennially ice-covered Lake Untersee, and CH biota from this glacier contribute up to one third of the community composition in benthic microbial mats within the lake. However, biogeochemical features of these CHs and associated spatial patterns across the glacier are still unknown. Here we hypothesized about the CH minerogenic composition between the different sources such as the medial moraine and other zones. Further, we intended to investigate if the depth of the CH mirrors the CH community composition, organic matter (OM) content and would support productivity. In this study we show that both microbial communities and biogeochemical parameters in CHs were significantly different between the zones medial moraine and the glacier terminus. Variations in microbial community composition are the result of factors such as depth, diameter, organic matter, total carbon, particle size, and mineral diversity. More than 90% of all ribosomal sequence variants (RSV) reads were classified as Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Archaea were detected in 85% of all samples and exclusively belonged to the classes Halobacteria, Methanomicrobia, and Thermoplasmata. The most abundant genus was Halorubrum (Halobacteria) and was identified in nine RSVs. The core microbiome for bacteria comprised 30 RSVs that were affiliated with Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. The archaeal fraction of the core microbiome consisted of three RSVs belonging to unknown genera of Methanomicrobiales and Thermoplasmatales and the genus Rice_Cluster_I (Methanocellales). Further, mean bacterial carbon production in cryoconite was exceptionally low and similar rates have not been reported elsewhere. However, bacterial carbon production insignificantly trended toward higher rates in shallow CHs and did not seem to be supported by accumulation of OM and nutrients, respectively, in deeper holes. OM fractions were significantly different between shallower CHs along the medial moraine and deeper CHs at the glacier terminus. Overall, our findings suggest that wind-blown material originating south and southeast of the Anuchin Glacier and deposits from a nunatak are assumed to be local inoculation sources. High sequence similarities between samples from the Untersee Oasis and other Antarctic sites further indicate long-range atmospheric transport mechanisms that complement local inoculation sources.},
