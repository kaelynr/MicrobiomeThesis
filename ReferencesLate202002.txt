AB  - Currently, membrane biofouling in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) is normally
      attributed to the occurrence of abundant bacterial species on membranes, whereas 
      the roles of low-abundance bacteria have not been paid sufficient attention. In
      this study, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm 
      was used to identify active biomarkers, determining 67 different phylotypes among
      Bulk sludge, low-fouling Bio-cake (10 kPa), high-fouling Bio-cake (25 kPa) and
      Membrane pore in a membrane bioreactor with NaOCl backwash. Interestingly, a
      large proportion of the active biomarkers in bio-cake samples, such as
      Methylophilaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Paucibacter and Pseudoxanthomonas, did not
      fall within the abundant taxa (i.e., <0.05% relative abundance), indicating the
      preferential growth of these low-abundance bacteria on the membrane surface.
      Furthermore, the characterization of microbial interactions using a random matrix
      theory (RMT)-based network approach obtained a network consisting of 120 nodes
      and 228 edges. Specifically, network analysis showed the presence of an intense
      competition among bacterial species in the fouling-related communities,
      suggesting that negative interactions have an important effect on determining the
      microbial community structure. More importantly, the LEfSe algorithm and network 
      analysis showed that most of the core species of the bio-cake, such as
      Burkholderiaceae, Bacillus and Rhodothermaceae, merely amounted to a very low
      relative abundance (<1%), suggesting their unrecognized and over-proportional
      ecological role in triggering the initial biofilm formation and subsequent
      biofilm maturation during MBR operation. Overall, this work should improve our
      understanding of the bacterial community structure on the fouled membranes in
      MBRs.

TI  - Distribution and Diversity of Ocular Microbial Communities in Diabetic Patients
      Compared with Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 314-324
LID - 10.1080/02713683.2017.1406528 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify differences in the major (core vs.
      variable) microbial genera of human subjects with and without diabetes. METHODS: 
      Bacterial 16S rRNA genes obtained from conjunctival swabs of 19 healthy subjects 
      and 30 diabetic patients were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and
      the sequencing data were analyzed using QIIME 1.9.1. To elucidate the microbial
      diversity in the ocular surface (OS), test programs from various bioinformatics
      domains were used. RESULTS: Diversity index and rarefaction analysis showed that 
      the microbial community of the diabetic patients was more diverse than that of
      the healthy subjects. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria
      and Bacteroidetes were the dominant taxa present in the OS, and there was a
      significant difference in the relative abundance of the bacterial phyla between
      the diabetic patients and control subjects. Proteobacteria were more abundant in 
      the diabetic group, whereas Firmicutes was more abundant in the control group.
      Analysis of bacterial taxa at the genus level showed that the core microbiome of 
      diabetic patients comprised Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and
      Ralstonia, whereas that of the controls comprised Bradyrhizobiaceae,
      Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, Neisseriaceae, and
      Acinetobacter. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the microbial
      community composition between diabetic patients and healthy subjects. A high
      abundance of Acinetobacter in the OS of diabetic patients may arise from the
      unique characteristics of the OS compared with those of other organ surfaces.

TI  - Antibiotics reduce genetic diversity of core species in the honeybee gut
      microbiome.
PG  - 2057-2066
LID - 10.1111/mec.14434 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiome plays a key role in animal health, and perturbing it can have 
      detrimental effects. One major source of perturbation to microbiomes, in humans
      and human-associated animals, is exposure to antibiotics. Most studies of how
      antibiotics affect the microbiome have used amplicon sequencing of highly
      conserved 16S rRNA sequences, as in a recent study showing that antibiotic
      treatment severely alters the species-level composition of the honeybee gut
      microbiome. But because the standard 16S rRNA-based methods cannot resolve
      closely related strains, strain-level changes could not be evaluated. To address 
      this gap, we used amplicon sequencing of protein-coding genes to assess effects
      of antibiotics on fine-scale genetic diversity of the honeybee gut microbiota. We
      followed the population dynamics of alleles within two dominant core species of
      the bee gut community, Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrassella alvi, following
      antibiotic perturbation. Whereas we observed a large reduction in genetic
      diversity in G. apicola, S. alvi diversity was mostly unaffected. The reduction
      in G. apicola diversity accompanied an increase in the frequency of several
      alleles, suggesting resistance to antibiotic treatment. We find that antibiotic
      perturbation can cause major shifts in diversity and that the extent of these
      shifts can vary substantially across species. Thus, antibiotics impact not only
      species composition, but also allelic diversity within species, potentially
      affecting hosts if variants with particular functions are reduced or eliminated. 
      Overall, we show that amplicon sequencing of protein-coding genes, without
      clustering into operational taxonomic units, provides an accurate picture of the 
      fine-scale dynamics of microbial communities over time.

AB  - Bovine milk contains a complex microbial community that affects the quality and
      safety of the product. Detailed knowledge of this microbiota is, therefore, of
      importance for the dairy industry. In this study, the bacterial composition of
      consumption milk was assessed during different stages in the production line and 
      throughout the storage in cartons by using culturing techniques and 16S rRNA
      marker gene sequencing. Monthly samples from two dairies were analyzed to capture
      the seasonal variations in the milk microbiota. Although there was a core
      microbiota present in milk samples from both dairies, the composition of the
      bacterial communities were significantly influenced by sampling month, processing
      stage and storage temperature. Overall, a higher abundance of operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) within the order Bacillales was detected in samples of raw
      and pasteurized milk from the spring and summer months, while Pseudomonadales and
      Lactobacillales OTUs were predominant in the winter months. OTUs belonging to the
      order Lactobacillales, Pseudomonadales, Clostridiales and Bacillales were
      significantly more abundant in milk samples taken immediately after
      pasteurization compared to raw milk samples. During storage of milk in cartons at
      4 degrees C, the bacterial composition remained stable throughout the product
      shelf life, while storage at 8 degrees C significantly increased the abundance of
      OTUs belonging to the genus Bacillus and the plate count levels of presumptive
      Bacillus cereus. The knowledge obtained in this work will be useful to the dairy 
      industry during their quality assurance work and risk assessment practices.

TI  - Groundwater Microbial Communities Along a Generalized Flowpath in Nomhon Area,
      Qaidam Basin, China.
PG  - 719-731
LID - 10.1111/gwat.12615 [doi]
AB  - Spatial distribution (horizonal and vertical) of groundwater microbial
      communities and the hydrogeochemistry in confined aquifers were studied
      approximately along the groundwater flow path from coteau to plain in the Nomhon 
      area, Qinghai-Tibet plateau, China. The confined groundwater samples at different
      depths and locations were collected in three boreholes through a hydrogeological 
      section in this arid and semi-arid area. The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA
      genes and multivariate statistical analysis were used to elucidate similarities
      and differences between groundwater microbial communities and hydrogeochemical
      properties. The integrated isotopic geochemical measurements were applied to
      estimate the source and recharge characteristics of groundwater. The results
      showed that groundwater varied from fresh to saline water, and modern water to
      ancient water following the flowpath. The recharge characteristics of the saline 
      water was distinct with that of fresh water. Cell abundance did not vary greatly 
      along the hydrogeochemical zonality; however, dissimilarities in habitat-based
      microbial community structures were evident, changing from Betaproteobacteria in 
      the apex of alluvial fan to Gammaproteobacteria and then to Epsilonproteobacteria
      in the core of the basin (alluvial-lacustrine plain). Rhodoferax, Hydrogenophaga,
      Pseudomonas, and bacterium isolated from similar habitats unevenly thrived in the
      spatially distinct fresh water environments, while Sulfurimonas dominanted in the
      saline water environment. The microbial communities presented likely reflected to
      the hydrogeochemical similarities and zonalities along groundwater flowpath.

AB  - Diversity and composition of lepidopteran microbiotas are poorly investigated,
      especially across the different developmental stages. To improve this knowledge, 
      we characterize the microbiota among different developmental stages of the Indian
      meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, which is considered one of the major pest of
      commodities worldwide. Using culture-independent approach based on Illumina 16S
      rRNA gene sequencing we characterized the microbiota of four developmental
      stages: eggs, first-, and last-instar larvae, and adult. A total of 1022
      bacterial OTUs were obtained, showing a quite diversified microbiota associated
      to all the analyzed stages. The microbiotas associated with P. interpunctella
      resulted almost constant throughout the developmental stages, with approximately 
      77% of bacterial OTUs belonging to the phylum of Proteobacteria. The dominant
      bacterial genus is represented by Burkholderia ( approximately 64%), followed by 
      Propionibacterium, Delftia, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas. A core bacterial
      community, composed of 139 OTUs, was detected in all the developmental stages,
      among which 112 OTUs were assigned to the genus Burkholderia. A phylogenetic
      reconstruction, based on the 16S rRNA, revealed that our Burkholderia OTUs
      clustered with Burkholderia cepacia complex, in the same group of those isolated 
      from the hemipterans Gossyparia spuria and Acanthococcus aceris. The functional
      profiling, predicted on the base of the bacterial 16S rRNA, indicates differences
      in the metabolic pathways related to metabolism of amino acids between
      preimaginal and adult stages. We can hypothesize that bacteria may support the
      insect host during preimaginal stages.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals are micropollutants often present in wastewater treatment
      systems. In this study, the potential impact of such micropollutants on the
      bacterial population within aerobic granular sludge (AGS) bioreactor was
      investigated. The AGS bacterial community structure and composition were accessed
      combining DGGE fingerprinting and barcoded pyrosequencing analysis. Both revealed
      the existence of a dynamic bacterial community, independently of the
      pharmaceuticals presence. The AGS microbiome at both phylum and class levels
      varied over time and, after stopping pharmaceuticals feeding, the bacterial
      community did not return to its initial composition. Nevertheless, most of the
      assigned OTUs were present throughout the different operational phases. This core
      microbiome, represented by over 72% of the total sequences in each phase,
      probably played an important role in biological removal processes, avoiding their
      failure during the disturbance period. Quantitative-PCR revealed that
      pharmaceuticals load led to gradual changes on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing
      bacteria (AOB), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and polyphosphate-accumulating
      organisms (PAO) but their persistence during that phase demonstrated the
      resilience of such bacterial groups. AGS microbiome changed over time but a core 
      community was maintained, probably ensuring the accomplishment of the main
      biological removal processes.

AB  - Understanding the role of microbiota as reproductive barriers or sources of
      adaptive novelty in the fundamental biological phenomenon of speciation is an
      exciting new challenge necessitating exploration of microbiota variation in wild 
      interbreeding species. We focused on two interbreeding cyprinid species,
      Chondrostoma nasus and Parachondrostoma toxostoma, which have geographic
      distributions characterized by a mosaic of hybrid zones. We described microbiota 
      diversity and composition in the three main teleost mucosal tissues, the skin,
      gills and gut, in the parental parapatric populations. We found that tissue type 
      was the principal determinant of bacterial community composition. In particular, 
      there was strong microbiota differentiation between external and internal
      tissues, with secondary discrimination between the two species. These findings
      suggest that specific environmental and genetic filters associated with each
      species have shaped the bacterial communities, potentially reflecting
      deterministic assemblages of bacteria. We defined the core microbiota common to
      both Chondrostoma species for each tissue, highlighting the occurrence of
      microbe-host genome interactions at this critical level for studies of the
      functional consequences of hybridization. Further investigations will explore to 
      what extend these specific tissue-associated microbiota signatures could be
      profoundly altered in hybrids, with functional consequences for post-mating
      reproductive isolation in relation to environmental constraints.

PG  - 529-542
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1068-x [doi]
AB  - The lower respiratory tract has been previously considered sterile in a healthy
      state, but advances in culture-independent techniques for microbial
      identification and characterization have revealed that the lung harbors a diverse
      microbiome. Although research on the lung microbiome is increasing and important 
      questions were already addressed, longitudinal studies aiming to describe
      developmental stages of the microbial communities from the early neonatal period 
      to adulthood are lacking. Thus, little is known about the early-life development 
      of the lung microbiome and the impact of external factors during these stages. In
      this study, we applied a barcoding approach based on high-throughput sequencing
      of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon libraries to determine age-dependent
      differences in the bacterial fraction of the murine lung microbiome and to assess
      potential influences of differing "environmental microbiomes" (simulated by the
      application of used litter material to the cages). We could clearly show that the
      diversity of the bacterial community harbored in the murine lung increases with
      age. Interestingly, bacteria belonging to the genera Delftia and Rhodococcus
      formed an age-independent core microbiome. The addition of the used litter
      material influenced the lung microbiota of young mice but did not significantly
      alter the community composition of adult animals. Our findings elucidate the
      dynamic nature of the early-life lung microbiota and its stabilization with age. 
      Further, this study indicates that even slight environmental changes modulate the
      bacterial community composition of the lung microbiome in early life, whereas the
      lung microbes of adults demonstrate higher resilience towards environmental
      variations.

TI  - The Gut Microbiome and Mental Health: Implications for Anxiety- and
      Trauma-Related Disorders.
PG  - 90-107
LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0077 [doi]
AB  - Biological psychiatry research has long focused on the brain in elucidating the
      neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. This review 
      challenges this assumption and suggests that the gut microbiome and its
      interactome also deserve attention to understand brain disorders and develop
      innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth
      characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health
      and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the gut microbiome in
      anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis sits
      at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an
      important role in the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
      axis early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we 
      highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in psychiatric disorders,
      focusing on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders specifically, and discuss the
      gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled
      researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals.
      The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics,
      metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the
      present review. Other factors that shape the gut microbiome should be considered 
      to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome
      linked to the MGB. In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science,
      and gut microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in mental illness 
      and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and 
      postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it
      plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health
      research in the next decade.

TI  - Seasonal Stability in the Microbiomes of Temperate Gorgonians and the Red Coral
      Corallium rubrum Across the Mediterranean Sea.

AB  - Populations of key benthic habitat-forming octocoral species have declined
      significantly in the Mediterranean Sea due to mass mortality events caused by
      microbial disease outbreaks linked to high summer seawater temperatures.
      Recently, we showed that the microbial communities of these octocorals are
      relatively structured; however, our knowledge on the seasonal dynamics of these
      microbiomes is still limited. To investigate their seasonal stability, we
      collected four soft gorgonian species (Eunicella singularis, Eunicella cavolini, 
      Eunicella verrucosa and Leptogorgia sarmentosa) and the precious red coral
      (Corallium rubrum) from two coastal locations with different terrestrial impact
      levels in the Mediterranean Sea, and used next-generation amplicon sequencing of 
      the 16S rRNA gene. The microbiomes of all soft gorgonian species were dominated
      by the same 'core microbiome' bacteria belonging to the Endozoicomonas and the
      Cellvibrionales clade BD1-7, whereas the red coral microbiome was primarily
      composed of 'core' Spirochaetes, Oceanospirillales ME2 and Parcubacteria. The
      associations with these bacterial taxa were relatively consistent over time at
      each location for each octocoral species. However, differences in microbiome
      composition and seasonal dynamics were observed between locations and could
      primarily be attributed to locally variant bacteria. Overall, our data provide
      further evidence of the intricate symbiotic relationships that exist between
      Mediterranean octocorals and their associated microbes, which are ancient and
      highly conserved over both space and time, and suggest regulation of the
      microbiome composition by the host, depending on local conditions.

TI  - Gut microbial communities of American pikas (Ochotona princeps): Evidence for
      phylosymbiosis and adaptations to novel diets.
PG  - 323-330
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.12692 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbial communities provide many physiological functions to their hosts,
      especially in herbivorous animals. We still lack an understanding of how these
      microbial communities are structured across hosts in nature, especially within a 
      given host species. Studies on laboratory mice have demonstrated that host
      genetics can influence microbial community structure, but that diet can overwhelm
      these genetic effects. We aimed to test these ideas in a natural system, the
      American pika (Ochotona princeps). First, pikas are high-elevation specialists
      with significant population structure across various mountain ranges in the USA, 
      allowing us to investigate whether similarities in microbial communities match
      host genetic differences. Additionally, pikas are herbivorous, with some
      populations exhibiting remarkable dietary plasticity and consuming high levels of
      moss, which is exceptionally high in fibre and low in protein. This allows us to 
      investigate adaptations to an herbivorous diet, as well as to the especially
      challenging diet of moss. Here, we inventoried the microbial communities of pika 
      caecal pellets from various populations using 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate 
      structuring of microbial communities across various populations with different
      natural diets. Microbial communities varied significantly across populations, and
      differences in microbial community structure were congruent with genetic
      differences in host population structure, a pattern known as "phylosymbiosis."
      Several microbial members (Ruminococcus, Prevotella, Oxalobacter and Coprococcus)
      were detected across all samples, and thus likely represent a "core microbiome." 
      These genera are known to perform a number of services for herbivorous hosts such
      as fibre fermentation and the degradation of plant defensive compounds, and thus 
      are likely important for herbivory in pikas. Moreover, pikas that feed on moss
      harboured microbial communities highly enriched in Melainabacteria. This
      uncultivable candidate phylum has been proposed to ferment fibre for herbivores, 
      and thus may contribute to the ability of some pika populations to consume high
      amounts of moss. These findings demonstrate that both host genetics and diet can 
      influence the microbial communities of the American pika. These animals may be
      novel sources of fibre-degrading microbes. Last, we discuss the implications of
      population-specific microbial communities for conservation efforts in this
      species.
