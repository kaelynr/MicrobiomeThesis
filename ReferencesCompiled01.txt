AB  - We sought to compare the vaginal microbiota profiles of Taiwanese women with
      severe preeclampsia (SPE) and normotensive control pregnancies. In a discovery
      cohort, vaginal swab samples and paired blood specimens were simultaneously
      obtained at the time of caesarean delivery from 30 women with SPE and 30
      controls. The composition of vaginal microbiota was characterised by 16S
      ribosomal RNA gene sequencing of the V3-V4 region. Results were subsequently
      validated by real-time qPCR. We sought confirmation of our findings in an
      expanded cohort consisting of 58 women with SPE and 55 controls. In both the
      discovery and confirmation cohorts, women with SPE had higher relative abundance 
      of Prevotella bivia in their vaginal microbial community (P = 0.006 and 0.011,
      respectively). Plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) were
      higher when compared with controls (P = 0.031) in the confirmation cohort. Three 
      variables (vaginal Prevotella bivia, plasma TNF-alpha, and body mass index [BMI])
      were included in a prediction panel for SPE. Of these, BMI was the most
      predictive variable. The area under the curve (AUC) of predicted probability
      values for the three-variable panel revealed that it can discriminate between SPE
      and normotensive pregnancies with good accuracy (AUC = 0.797, P < 0.001). We
      conclude that enrichment of Prevotella bivia in vaginal microbiota, which is
      tightly regulated by BMI, may be involved in the pathogenesis of SPE.

AB  - Seagrasses represent high primary productivity and provide important ecosystem
      services to the marine environment. Seagrass-associated microbial communities are
      playing essential ecological functional roles in biogeochemical cycles. However, 
      little is known about the effect of seagrass vegetation on microbial communities 
      in sediment. In the present study, the sediment cores of seagrass bed (dominated 
      by Zostera japonica and Zostera marine) and degradation area in Swan Lake (China)
      were sampled; then, biogeochemical parameters were analyzed, and microbial
      community composition was investigated by using high-throughput sequencing of the
      16S rRNA gene. The results showed that the presence of seagrass could lead to a
      decrease in the richness and diversity of the microbial community. In the
      vertical direction, a pronounced shift from Proteobacteria-dominated upper layers
      to Chloroflexi and Crenarchaeota-dominated deep layers in all sediment cores were
      observed. Besides, Bathyarchaeia is more abundant at degradation area, while
      Vibrionaceae, Sulfurovum and Lokiarchaeial overrepresent at the seagrass bed
      area. Vibrionaceae was abundant in the rhizosphere of Z. marina and Z. japonica, 
      and the proportions reached 84.45% and 63.89%, respectively. This enrichment of
      Vibrio spp. may be caused by the macrobenthic species near the seagrass
      rhizosphere, and these Vibrio spp. reduced the diversity and stability of
      microbial community, which may lead to the degradation of seagrass. This study
      would provide clues for the distribution patterns and niche preferences of
      seagrass microbiome. The conservation strategy of seagrass would be further
      elucidated from the perspective of the microbiome.

TI  - Mucin-derived O-glycans supplemented to diet mitigate diverse microbiota
      perturbations.
LID - 10.1038/s41396-020-00798-6 [doi]
AB  - Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) are powerful modulators of microbiota 
      composition and function. These substrates are often derived from diet, such as
      complex polysaccharides from plants or human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) during 
      breastfeeding. Host-derived mucus glycans on gut-secreted mucin proteins serve as
      a continuous endogenous source of MACs for resident microbes; here we investigate
      the potential role of purified, orally administered mucus glycans in maintaining 
      a healthy microbial community. In this study, we liberated and purified O-linked 
      glycans from porcine gastric mucin and assessed their efficacy in shaping the
      recovery of a perturbed microbiota in a mouse model. We found that porcine mucin 
      glycans (PMGs) and HMOs enrich for taxonomically similar resident microbes. We
      demonstrate that PMGs aid recovery of the microbiota after antibiotic treatment, 
      suppress Clostridium difficile abundance, delay the onset of diet-induced
      obesity, and increase the relative abundance of resident Akkermansia muciniphila.
      In silico analysis revealed that genes associated with mucus utilization are
      abundant and diverse in prevalent gut commensals and rare in enteric pathogens,
      consistent with these glycan-degrading capabilities being selected for during
      host development and throughout the evolution of the host-microbe relationship.
      Importantly, we identify mucus glycans as a novel class of prebiotic compounds
      that can be used to mitigate perturbations to the microbiota and provide benefits
      to host physiology.

TI  - Diversity of gut microbiomes in marine fishes is shaped by host-related factors.
LID - 10.1111/mec.15699 [doi]
AB  - Microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract of animals play vital roles in food 
      digestion, homeostasis and immune response regulation. Globally, there are 33,700
      fish species, representing almost half of all vertebrate diversity and a wide
      range of physiologies, ecologies and life histories. To investigate gut
      microbiomes with high coverage, we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing
      with samples of 20 common marine fish. The fish gut microbiome is a remarkably
      simple community with low microbial diversity (a maximum of 300 amplicon sequence
      variants only) and has up to 70% of unknown species in some fish species. The gut
      microbial community structure was significantly shaped by the combined influence 
      of host-associated factors, including the fish taxon (p < 0.001, R(2) = 0.16,
      omega(2) = 0.04), feeding habit (p < 0.001, R(2) = 0.06, omega(2) = 0.02) and
      trophic level (p < 0.01, R(2) = 0.04, omega(2) = 0.01), although the influence
      was subtle with a small effect size. The core gut microbiomes of different
      feeding habits was also previously discovered in animal-associated and
      corresponding habitat samples. Certain energy metabolism pathways were enriched
      in herbivore/omnivore and zooplanktivore/zoobenthivore fishes, whereas lipid
      metabolism and glycan metabolism were enriched in zoobenthivore/piscivore fishes.
      Moreover, substantial taxonomic variability was found between the gut microbiomes
      of fish and animals, indicated by their low degree of shared microbiota. The data
      and observations reported herein pave the way for further investigations on the
      coevolution of fish gut microbiomes and their hosts, the physiological functions 
      of gut microorganisms, and the development of probiotics for improving the
      nutrition and health of aquaculture fish species.

AB  - Since the last few decades, the promiscuous and uncontrolled use of plastics led 
      to the accumulation of millions of tons of plastic waste in the terrestrial and
      marine environment. It elevated the risk of environmental pollution and climate
      change. The concern arises more due to the reckless and unscientific disposal of 
      plastics containing high molecular weight polymers, viz., polystyrene, polyamide,
      polyvinylchloride, polypropylene, polyurethane, and polyethylene, etc. which are 
      very difficult to degrade. Thus, the focus is now paid to search for efficient,
      eco-friendly, low-cost waste management technology. Of them, degradation of
      non-degradable synthetic polymer using diverse microbial agents, viz., bacteria, 
      fungi, and other extremophiles become an emerging option. So far, very few
      microbial agents and their secreted enzymes have been identified and
      characterized for plastic degradation, but with low efficiency. It might be due
      to the predominance of uncultured microbial species, which consequently remain
      unexplored from the respective plastic degrading milieu. To overcome this
      problem, metagenomic analysis of microbial population engaged in the plastic
      biodegradation is advisable to decipher the microbial community structure and to 
      predict their biodegradation potential in situ. Advancements in sequencing
      technologies and bioinformatics analysis allow the rapid metagenome screening
      that helps in the identification of total microbial community and also opens up
      the scope for mining genes or enzymes (hydrolases, laccase, etc.) engaged in
      polymer degradation. Further, the extraction of the core microbial population and
      their adaptation, fitness, and survivability can also be deciphered through
      comparative metagenomic study. It will help to engineer the microbial community
      and their metabolic activity to speed up the degradation process.

AB  - Regional acclimatisation and microbial interactions significantly influence the
      resilience of reef-building corals facing anthropogenic climate change, allowing 
      them to adapt to environmental stresses. However, the connections between
      community structure and microbial interactions of the endemic coral microbiome
      and holobiont acclimatisation remain unclear. Herein, we used generation
      sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS2) and 16S rRNA genes to
      investigate the microbiome composition (Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria) and
      associated potential interactions of endemic dominant coral holobionts
      (Pocillopora verrucosa and Turbinaria peltata) in the South China Sea (SCS). We
      found that shifts in Symbiodiniaceae and bacterial communities of P. verrucosa
      were associated with latitudinal gradient and climate zone changes, respectively.
      The C1 sub-clade consistently dominated the Symbiodiniaceae community in T.
      peltata; yet, the bacterial community structure was spatially heterogeneous. The 
      relative abundance of the core microbiome among P. verrucosa holobionts was
      reduced in the biogeographical transition zone, while bacterial taxa associated
      with anthropogenic activity (Escherichia coli and Sphingomonas) were identified
      in the core microbiomes. Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria potentially interact in
      microbial co-occurrence networks. Further, increased bacterial, and
      Symbiodiniaceae alpha-diversity was associated with increased and decreased
      network complexity, respectively. Hence, Symbiodiniaceae and bacteria
      demonstrated different flexibility in latitudinal or climatic environmental
      regimes, which correlated with holobiont acclimatisation. Core microbiome
      analysis has indicated that the function of core bacterial microbiota might have 
      changed in distinct environmental regimes, implying potential human activity in
      the coral habitats. Increased bacterial alpha diversity may lead to a decline in 
      the stability of coral-microorganism symbioses, whereas rare Symbiodiniaceae may 
      help to retain symbioses. Cladocopium, gamma-proteobacteria, while
      alpha-proteobacteria may have been the primary drivers in the
      Symbiodiniaceae-bacterial interactions (SBIs). Our study highlights the
      association between microbiome shift in distinct environmental regimes and
      holobiont acclimatisation, while providing insights into the impact of SBIs on
      holobiont health and acclimatisation during climate change.

AB  - Epibiotic microorganisms link seagrass productivity to higher trophic levels, but
      little is known about the processes structuring these communities, and which taxa
      consistently associate with seagrass. We investigated epibiotic microeukaryotes
      on seagrass (Zostera marina) leaves, substrates and planktonic microeukaryotes in
      ten meadows in the Northeast Pacific. Seagrass epibiotic communities are distinct
      from planktonic and substrate communities. We found sixteen core microeukaryotes,
      including dinoflagellates, diatoms, and saprotrophic stramenopiles. Some likely
      use seagrass leaves as a substrate, others for grazing, or they may be
      saprotrophic organisms involved in seagrass decomposition or parasites; their
      relatives have been previously reported from marine sediments and in association 
      with other hosts such as seaweeds. Core microeukaryotes were spatially structured
      and none were ubiquitous across meadows. Seagrass epibiota were more spatially
      structured than planktonic communities, mostly due to spatial distance and
      changes in abiotic conditions across space. Seawater communities were relatively 
      more similar in composition across sites and more influenced by the environmental
      component, but more variable over time. Core and transient taxa were both mostly 
      structured by spatial distance and the abiotic environment, with little effect of
      host attributes, further indicating that those core taxa would not show a strong 
      specific association with Z. marina.

AB  - Microbes form close associations with host plants including rice as both surface 
      (epiphytes) and internal (endophytes) inhabitants. Yet despite rice being one of 
      the most important cereal crops agriculturally and economically, knowledge of its
      microbiome, particularly core inhabitants and any functional properties bestowed 
      is limited. In this study, the microbiome in rice seedlings derived directly from
      seeds was identified, characterized and compared to the microbiome of the seed.
      Rice seeds were sourced from two different locations in Arkansas, USA of two
      different rice genotypes (Katy, M202) from two different harvest years (2013,
      2014). Seeds were planted in sterile media and bacterial as well as fungal
      communities were identified through 16S and ITS sequencing, respectively, for
      four seedling compartments (root surface, root endosphere, shoot surface, shoot
      endosphere). Overall, 966 bacterial and 280 fungal ASVs were found in seedlings. 
      Greater abundance and diversity were detected for the microbiome associated with 
      roots compared to shoots and with more epiphytes than endophytes. The seedling
      compartments were the driving factor for microbial community composition rather
      than other factors such as rice genotype, location and harvest year. Comparison
      with datasets from seeds revealed that 91 (out of 296) bacterial and 11 (out of
      341) fungal ASVs were shared with seedlings with the majority being retained
      within root tissues. Core bacterial and fungal microbiome shared across seedling 
      samples were identified. Core bacteria genera identified in this study such as
      Rhizobium, Pantoea, Sphingomonas, and Paenibacillus have been reported as plant
      growth promoting bacteria while core fungi such as Pleosporales, Alternaria and
      Occultifur have potential as biocontrol agents.

TI  - Dysbiosis in the Dead: Human Postmortem Microbiome Beta-Dispersion as an
      Indicator of Manner and Cause of Death.
PG  - 555347
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.555347 [doi]
AB  - The postmortem microbiome plays an important functional role in host
      decomposition after death. Postmortem microbiome community successional patterns 
      are specific to body site, with a significant shift in composition 48 h after
      death. While the postmortem microbiome has important forensic applications for
      postmortem interval estimation, it also has the potential to aid in manner of
      death (MOD) and cause of death (COD) determination as a reflection of antemortem 
      health status. To further explore this association, we tested beta-dispersion, or
      the variability of microbiomes within the context of the "Anna Karenina
      Principle" (AKP). The foundational principle of AKP is that stressors affect
      microbiomes in unpredictable ways, which increases community beta-dispersion. We 
      hypothesized that cases with identified M/CODs would have differential community 
      beta-dispersion that reflected antemortem conditions, specifically that
      cardiovascular disease and/or natural deaths would have higher beta-dispersion
      compared to other deaths (e.g., accidents, drug-related deaths). Using a
      published microbiome data set of 188 postmortem cases (five body sites per case) 
      collected during routine autopsy in Wayne County (Detroit), MI, we modeled
      beta-dispersion to test for M/COD associations a priori. Logistic regression
      models of beta-dispersion and case demographic data were used to classify M/COD. 
      We demonstrated that beta-dispersion, along with case demographic data, could
      distinguish among M/COD - especially cardiovascular disease and drug related
      deaths, which were correctly classified in 79% of cases. Binary logistic
      regression models had higher correct classifications than multinomial logistic
      regression models, but changing the defined microbial community (e.g., full vs.
      non-core communities) used to calculate beta-dispersion overall did not improve
      model classification or M/COD. Furthermore, we tested our analytic approach on a 
      case study that predicted suicides from other deaths, as well as distinguishing
      MOD (e.g., homicides vs. suicides) within COD (e.g., gunshot wound). We propose
      an analytical workflow that combines postmortem microbiome indicator taxa,
      beta-dispersion, and case demographic data for predicting MOD and COD
      classifications. Overall, we provide further evidence the postmortem microbiome
      is linked to the host's antemortem health condition(s), while also demonstrating 
      the potential utility of including beta-dispersion (a non-taxon dependent
      approach) coupled with case demographic data for death determination.

TI  - Gut dysbiosis in Huntington's disease: associations among gut microbiota,
      cognitive performance and clinical outcomes.
PG  - fcaa110
LID - 10.1093/braincomms/fcaa110 [doi]
AB  - Huntington's disease is characterized by a triad of motor, cognitive and
      psychiatric impairments, as well as unintended weight loss. Although much of the 
      research has focused on cognitive, motor and psychiatric symptoms, the extent of 
      peripheral pathology and the relationship between these factors, and the core
      symptoms of Huntington's disease, are relatively unknown. Gut microbiota are key 
      modulators of communication between the brain and gut, and alterations in
      microbiota composition (dysbiosis) can negatively affect cognition, behaviour and
      affective function, and may be implicated in disease progression. Furthermore,
      gut dysbiosis was recently reported in Huntington's disease transgenic mice. Our 
      main objective was to characterize the gut microbiome in people with Huntington's
      disease and determine whether the composition of gut microbiota are significantly
      related to clinical indicators of disease progression. We compared 42
      Huntington's disease gene expansion carriers, including 19 people who were
      diagnosed with Huntington's disease (Total Functional Capacity > 6) and 23 in the
      premanifest stage, with 36 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Participants
      were characterized clinically using a battery of cognitive tests and using
      results from 16S V3 to V4 rRNA sequencing of faecal samples to characterize the
      gut microbiome. For gut microbiome measures, we found significant differences in 
      the microbial communities (beta diversity) based on unweighted UniFrac distance
      (P = 0.001), as well as significantly lower alpha diversity (species richness and
      evenness) between our combined Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group 
      and healthy controls (P = 0.001). We also found major shifts in the microbial
      community structure at Phylum and Family levels, and identified functional
      pathways and enzymes affected in our Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier 
      group. Within the Huntington's disease gene expansion carrier group, we also
      discovered associations among gut bacteria, cognitive performance and clinical
      outcomes. Overall, our findings suggest an altered gut microbiome in Huntington's
      disease gene expansion carriers. These results highlight the importance of gut
      biomarkers and raise interesting questions regarding the role of the gut in
      Huntington's disease, and whether it may be a potential target for future
      therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Appropriate development of the intestinal microbiota during infancy is known to
      be important for human health. In fact, aberrant alterations of the microbial
      composition during childhood may cause short- and/or long-term negative health
      effects. Many factors influence the initial assembly and subsequent progression
      of the gut microbiota of a neonate, such as feeding type, delivery mode,
      gestational age, maternal metabolic status and antibiotic exposure. In the
      current study, the composition of the infant gut core-microbiota was explored,
      revealing particular variations of this core-microbiota during the first three
      years as influenced by delivery mode and feeding type. A multi-population cohort 
      meta-analysis was performed by selecting 15 publicly available datasets
      pertaining to taxonomic profiles of 1035 fecal samples of healthy infants, as
      obtained by means of a 16S rRNA gene-based profiling approach. Interestingly,
      this multi-population cohort meta-analysis revealed great microbial complexity
      and specific taxonomic shifts in children older than six months, suggesting a
      major impact by the introduction of solid foods which prompts progression of
      infant gut microbiota towards that typical of adults. The taxonomic data sets
      employed in this multi-population cohort meta-analysis possess the statistical
      robustness to allow the identification of infant community state types (ICSTs).
      Our analysis therefore reveals the existence of specific taxonomic patterns that 
      correspond to particular nutritional and developmental stages of early life, and 
      that had previously been obscured by the high variability typical of such infant 
      gut microbiota.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: An increased prevalence of periodontitis and perturbation of the oral
      microbiome has been identified in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The
      periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis may cause local citrullination of
      proteins, potentially triggering anti-citrullinated protein antibody production. 
      However, it is not known if oral dysbiosis precedes the onset of clinical
      arthritis. This study comprehensively characterised the oral microbiome in
      anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) positive at-risk individuals without
      clinical synovitis (CCP+at risk). METHODS: Subgingival plaque was collected from 
      periodontally healthy and diseased sites in 48 CCP+at risk, 26 early RA and 32
      asymptomatic healthy control (HC) individuals. DNA libraries were sequenced on
      the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform. Taxonomic profile and functional capability of 
      the subgingival microbiome were compared between groups. RESULTS: At
      periodontally healthy sites, CCP+at risk individuals had significantly lower
      microbial richness compared with HC and early RA groups (p=0.004 and 0.021).
      Microbial community alterations were found at phylum, genus and species levels. A
      large proportion of the community differed significantly in membership (523
      species; 35.6%) and structure (575 species; 39.1%) comparing CCP+at risk and HC
      groups. Certain core species, including P. gingivalis, had higher relative
      abundance in the CCP+at risk group. Seventeen clusters of orthologous gene
      functional units were significantly over-represented in the CCP+at risk group
      compared with HC (adjusted p value <0.05). CONCLUSION: Anti-CCP positive at-risk 
      individuals have dysbiotic subgingival microbiomes and increased abundance of P. 
      gingivalis compared with controls. This supports the hypothesis that the oral
      microbiome and specifically P. gingivalis are important in RA initiation.

AB  - More than 1,000 different species of microbes have been found to live within the 
      human oral cavity, where they play important roles in maintaining both oral and
      systemic health. Several studies have identified the core members of this
      microbial community; however, the factors that determine oral microbiome
      composition are not well understood. In this study, we exam the salivary oral
      microbiome of 1,049 Atlantic Canadians using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to
      determine which dietary, lifestyle, and anthropometric features play a role in
      shaping microbial community composition. Features that were identified as being
      significantly associated with overall composition then were additionally examined
      for genera, amplicon sequence variants, and predicted pathway abundances that
      were associated with these features. Several associations were replicated in an
      additional secondary validation data set. Overall, we found that several
      anthropometric measurements, including waist-hip ratio (WHR), height, and
      fat-free mass, as well as age and sex, were associated with overall oral
      microbiome structure in both our exploratory and validation data sets. We were
      unable to validate any dietary impacts on overall taxonomic oral microbiome
      composition but did find evidence to suggest potential contributions from factors
      such as the number of vegetable and refined grain servings an individual
      consumes. Interestingly, each one of these factors on its own was associated with
      only minor shifts in the overall taxonomic composition of the oral microbiome,
      suggesting that future biomarker identification for several diseases associated
      with the oral microbiome can be undertaken without the worry of confounding
      factors obscuring biological signals.IMPORTANCE The human oral cavity is
      inhabited by a diverse community of microbes, known as the human oral microbiome.
      These microbes play a role in maintaining both oral and systemic health and, as
      such, have been proposed to be useful biomarkers of disease. However, to identify
      these biomarkers, we first need to determine the composition and variation of the
      healthy oral microbiome. In this report, we investigate the oral microbiome of
      1,049 healthy individuals to determine which genera and amplicon sequence
      variants are commonly found between individual oral microbiomes. We then further 
      investigate how lifestyle, anthropometric, and dietary choices impact overall
      microbiome composition. Interestingly, the results from this investigation showed
      that while many features were significantly associated with oral microbiome
      composition, no single biological factor explained a variation larger than 2%.
      These results indicate that future work on biomarker detection may be encouraged 
      by the lack of strong confounding factors.

TI  - Longitudinal metatranscriptomic analysis of a meat spoilage microbiome detects
      abundant continued fermentation and environmental stress responses during shelf
      life and beyond.
LID - AEM.01575-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01575-20 [doi]
AB  - Microbial food spoilage is a complex phenomenon associated with the succession of
      the specific spoilage organisms (SSO) over the course of time. We performed a
      longitudinal metatranscriptomic study on one modified atmosphere packaged (MAP)
      beef product to increase understanding of the longitudinal behavior of a spoilage
      microbiome during shelf life and onward. Based on the annotation of the mRNA
      reads, we recognized three stages related to the active microbiome that were
      descriptive for the sensory quality of the beef: acceptable product (AP), early
      spoilage (ES) and late spoilage (LS). Both the 16S RNA taxonomic assignments from
      the total RNA and functional annotations of the active genes showed that these
      stages were significantly different from each other. However, the functional gene
      annotations showed more pronounced difference than the taxonomy assignments.
      Psychrotrophic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) formed the core of the SSO according to
      the transcribed reads. Leuconostoc species were the most abundant active LAB
      throughout the study period, whereas the transcription activity of
      Streptococcaceae (mainly Lactococcus) increased after the product was spoiled. In
      the beginning of the experiment, the community managed environmental stress by
      cold-shock responses which were followed by the expression of the genes involved 
      in managing oxidative stress. Glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and pyruvate 
      metabolism were active throughout the study at a relatively stable level.
      However, the proportional transcription activity of the enzymes in these pathways
      changed over time.ImportanceIt is generally known which organisms are the typical
      SSO in foods, whereas the actively transcribed genes and pathways during
      microbial succession are poorly understood. This knowledge is important since
      better approaches to food quality evaluation and shelf life determination are
      needed. Thus, we conducted this study to find longitudinal markers that are
      connected to quality deterioration in a MAP beef product. These kind of RNA
      markers could be used to develop novel type of rapid quality analysis tools in
      the future. New tools are needed since even though SSO can be detected and their 
      concentrations determined using the current microbiological methods, results from
      these analyses cannot predict how close timewise a spoilage community is from
      production of clear sensory defects. Main reason for this is that the species
      composition of a spoilage community does not change dramatically during late
      shelf life, whereas the ongoing metabolic activities lead to the development of
      notable sensory deterioration.

TI  - Newly-introduced Cardinium endosymbiont reduces microbial diversity in the rice
      brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens.
LID - fiaa194 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiaa194 [doi]
AB  - Symbiotic microorganisms in invertebrates play vital roles in host ecology and
      evolution. Cardinium, a common intracellular symbiont, is transinfected into the 
      important agricultural pest Nilaparvata lugens (rice brown planthopper) to
      regulate its reproduction, but how this impacts its microbial community is
      unknown. Here, we characterized the bacterial microbiota from N. lugens, with or 
      without Cardinium, at different developmental stages and in various adult tissues
      using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Upon infection with Cardinium, we found that
      microbial diversity in the different developmental stages of N. lugens
      (especially females), and in female midguts and male testes, was lower than in
      the uninfected control. There was a negative correlation between Cardinium and
      most related genera and between Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Although the
      microbial structure varied during Cardinium infection, Acinetobacter spp. was a
      core microbiome genus. The Cardinium infection enhanced the relative density of
      midgut-associated Acinetobacter spp., with both bacteria exhibiting
      tissue-specific tropism. In addition, this infection caused the changes of main
      microbial functions in N. lugens. These results offer insights into the effects
      of alien (i.e. newly-introduced from other organism) Cardinium infection on N.
      lugens-associated microbiotas, aiding in the development of transinfected
      endosymbionts for pest control.

TI  - Effects of Antibiotics on the Dynamic Balance of Bacteria and Fungi in the Gut of
      the German Cockroach.
LID - toaa205 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jee/toaa205 [doi]
AB  - The German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.) (Blattaria: Blattidae) harbored
      diverse microorganisms in the digestive tract, including bacteria, fungi,
      viruses, archaea, and protozoa. This diverse community maintains a relatively
      stable balance. Some bacteria have been confirmed to play crucial roles in the
      insect's physiology, biochemistry, and behavior. Antibiotics can effectively
      eliminate bacteria and disrupt the balance of gut microbiota, but the time-course
      of this process, the structure of the new microbial community, and the dynamics
      of re-assemblage of a bacterial community after antibiotic treatment have not
      been investigated. In the present study, antibiotic (levofloxacin and gentamicin)
      ingestion reduced bacterial diversity and abundance in the cockroach gut. Within 
      14 d of discontinuing antibiotic treatment, the number of culturable gut bacteria
      returned to its original level. However, the composition of the new bacterial
      community with greater abundance of antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus and
      Dysgonomonas was significantly different from the original community. Network
      analysis showed that antibiotic treatment made the interaction between bacteria
      and fungi closer and stronger in the cockroach gut during the recovery of gut
      microorganisms. The study on the composition change, recovery rules, and
      interaction dynamics between gut bacteria and fungi after antibiotic treatment
      are helpful to explore gut microbes' colonization and interaction with insects,
      which contributes to the selection of stable core gut bacteria as biological
      carriers of paratransgenesis for controlling Blattella germanica.

AB  - In this study, 16S rRNA gene high throughput sequencing and Fluorescence In Situ 
      Hybridization (FISH) combined with confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) were
      used to assess for the first time biodiversity and structure of
      microplastic-associated biofilms (plastisphere) collected from Italian lentic
      ecosystems. The analysis revealed clear differences in microbial community
      composition among biofilms and corresponding planktonic populations indicating a 
      selective adhesion on microplastics (MP). Although geographical variations in
      taxa composition were observed, a plastisphere core microbiome, composed by known
      biofilm formers found in freshwater ecosystems (e.g. Sphingorhabdus,
      Sphingomonas, Rhodobacter, Aquabacterium and Acidovorax genera) was found.
      Species composition of plastisphere did not substantially differ between the
      diverse polymers, while a clear link with the MP exposure time was found by
      Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and Scanning Electron Microscopy 
      (SEM) analysis. Generalist planktonic taxa (e.g. members of the families
      Sphingomonadaceae and Rhodobacteraceae) were found on MPs with the lowest
      degradation level whereas the biodiversity increased with the increase of MP
      degradation. FISH-CLSM analysis confirmed the Burkolderiaceae dominance in most
      of the analyzed plastisphere samples and revealed a patchy microbial colonization
      and a complex biofilm architecture with bacterial micro-colonies and
      cyanobacterial aggregates occurring together with microalgae assemblages.

TI  - Assessment of the efficacy of a fatigue management therapy in schizophrenia:
      study protocol for a randomized, controlled multi-centered study (ENERGY).
PG  - 797
LID - 10.1186/s13063-020-04606-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a well-known common clinical feature of numerous chronic
      diseases including various forms of cancer, neurological disorders such as
      multiple sclerosis, and psychiatric disorders. A significant proportion of people
      with schizophrenia (30-60%) reportedly experience fatigue, which impacts
      negatively on participation in various activities, including work, study,
      leisure, and social pursuits. Causes of fatigue in schizophrenia are poorly
      understood and there are no established treatments. Several evidence-based
      interventions for fatigue syndrome including psychoeducation, cognitive
      behavioral therapy, and graded exercise therapy have been shown to be effective
      in other medical conditions and could be adapted to address fatigue in
      schizophrenia patients. As there are no psychosocial or pharmacological
      interventions with proved efficacy for fatigue in schizophrenia, there is an
      urgent need for the development of strategies to improve fatigue management in
      schizophrenia. The aim of this project is to evaluate in a single blind
      randomized clinical trial the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)
      intervention compared to treatment as usual (TAU) on fatigue as the main outcome 
      in schizophrenia patients. Clinical symptoms, physical functioning, major
      cognitive functions, quality of life and functioning, treatment dosage, daily
      motor activity, biological markers with inflammatory markers are also considered 
      as secondary outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: Two hundred patients meeting the inclusion
      criteria will be randomized to either of the study arms (intervention or TAU).
      The ENERGY intervention will be delivered according to a standardized treatment
      manual comprising six modules addressing fatigue and sleep over 14 individual
      therapy sessions. The treatment encompasses core CBT principles of
      psycho-education, behavioral activation, behavioral experiments, cognitive
      restructuring, problem-solving, and relapse prevention. Sessions will follow the 
      traditional CBT structure of agenda setting, review of homework tasks, and
      introduction of a new concept/technique with collaborative discussions on how to 
      implement such strategies in the participant's day-to-day environment. Our
      primary endpoint will be the severity of fatigue assessed at baseline and at the 
      9-month follow-up using the "Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory" (MFI).
      DISCUSSION: The trial will provide the first test of CBT intervention for fatigue
      for patients with schizophrenia. This study will also test to what extent the
      treatment can be implemented in everyday practice. TRIAL REGISTRATION:
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04332601 . Registered on 10 April 2020.

AB  - Childhood obesity and its consequences are a significant public health problem
      worldwide. Gut microbiota has a potential role in the development of. In the
      current datasets, we present 16S rDNA amplicon metasequencing of the gut
      microbiome of adolescents with normal weight, obesity, and obesity with irritable
      bowel syndrome (IBS) carried out using the Illumine platform. The datasets
      presented in this report are partly shown in the research article named
      "Composition and Structure of Gut Microbiome in Adolescents with Obesity and
      Different Breastfeeding Duration" [1]. The amplicon metasequencing data were
      deposited at NCBI SRA as BioProject PRJNA604466. A total of 22 phyla, 34 classes,
      and 231 genera were revealed. Three groups of adolescents had 196 core amplicon
      sequence variant (ASV), whereas 45, 24, and 1 ASV were unique for adolescents
      with normal body weight, obesity, and obesity with IBS, respectively. The
      metagenomic data were first obtained for adolescents from Eastern Siberian,
      Russia. They have the potential for predictive analysis, which is crucial for
      understanding microbial community dynamics and their role in the development of
      the intestinal microbiome. Considering the recent focus on gut microbiota, new
      datasets are needed to determine the association between gut microbes and the
      weight of adolescents from previously unexplored regions such as Siberia, Russia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex differences exist in asthma susceptibility and severity.
      Accumulating evidence has linked airway microbiome dysbiosis to asthma, and
      airway microbial communities have been found to differ by sex. However, whether
      sex modifies the link between airway microbiome and asthma has not been
      investigated. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sex effects in the association between
      airway microbiome and asthma. METHODS: We analyzed induced sputum samples from 47
      subjects (n = 23 patients with asthma and n = 24 normal controls) using 16S
      ribosomal RNA gene sequencing methods. The bacterial composition was analyzed for
      sex differences. Bacterial associations with asthma were assessed for each sex at
      the core taxa and genus levels. RESULTS: The microbiome in induced sputum
      differed in women vs men at the community level. A total of 5 core bacterial taxa
      were found in all samples. No sex-specific core taxa were detected. The most
      abundant core taxon, Streptococcus salivarius, was significantly enriched in
      women than in men (P = .02). Within each sex, individuals with relatively lower
      abundance of S salivarius were more likely to have asthma (P = .006). For both
      sexes, increased Lactobacillus species were found in sputum samples of patients
      with patients compared with normal controls (adjusted P = .01). Haemophilus
      species were associated with asthma in men and not in women. CONCLUSION: The
      airway microbiome differed by sex, and sex effects exist in the association of
      airway microbial markers and asthma. Future airway microbiome studies may yield
      better resolution if the context of specific sex is considered. The airway
      microbiome is a potential mechanism driving sex differences in asthma.

TI  - Metagenome Across a Geochemical Gradient of Indian Stone Ruins Found at Historic 
      Sites in Tamil Nadu, India.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-020-01598-3 [doi]
AB  - Although stone surfaces seem unlikely to be habitable, they support microbial
      life. Life on these surfaces are subjected to many varying harsh conditions and
      require the inhabitants to exhibit resistance to environmental factors including 
      UV irradiation, toxic metal exposure, and fluctuating temperatures and humidity. 
      Here we report the effect of hosting stone geochemistry on the microbiome of
      stone ruins found in Tamil Nadu, India. The microbial communities found on the
      two lithologies, granite and granodiorite, hosted distinct populations of
      bacteria. Geochemical composition analysis of sampled stones revealed quartz
      mineral content as a major driver of microbial community structure, particularly 
      promoting community richness and proportions of Cyanobacteria and
      Deinococcus-Thermus. Other geochemical parameters including ilmenite, albite,
      anorthite, and orthoclase components or elemental concentrations (Ti, Fe, Mn, Na,
      and K) also influenced community structure to a lesser degree than quartz. Core
      members of the stone microbiome community found on both lithologies were also
      identified and included Cyanobacteria (Chroococcidiopsaceae and Dapisostemonum
      CCIBt 3536), Rubrobacter, and Deinococcus. A cluster of taxa including
      Sphingomonas, Geodermatophilus, and Truepera were mostly found in the
      granodiorite samples. Community diversity correlated with quartz mineral content 
      in these samples may indicate that the microbial communities that attach to
      quartz surfaces may be transient and regularly changing. This work has expanded
      our understanding of built-stone microbial community structure based on lithology
      and geochemistry.

TI  - Systematic analysis of gut microbiota in pregnant women and its correlations with
      individual heterogeneity.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1038/s41522-020-00142-y [doi]
AB  - The woman's gut microbiota during pregnancy may support nutrient acquisition, is 
      associated with diseases, and has been linked to infant health. However, there is
      limited information on gut microbial characteristics and dependence in pregnant
      women. In this study, we provide a comprehensive overview of the gut microbial
      characteristics of 1479 pregnant women using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal
      samples. We identify a core microbiota of pregnant women, which displays a
      similar overall structure to that of age-matched nonpregnant women. Our data show
      that the gestational age-associated variation in the gut microbiota, from the
      ninth week of gestation to antepartum, is relatively limited. Building upon rich 
      metadata, we reveal a set of exogenous and intrinsic host factors that are highly
      correlated with the variation in gut microbial community composition and
      function. These microbiota covariates are concentrated in basic host properties
      (e.g., age and residency status) and blood clinical parameters, suggesting that
      individual heterogeneity is the major force shaping the gut microbiome during
      pregnancy. Moreover, we identify microbial and functional markers that are
      associated with age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, residency status, and
      pre-pregnancy and gestational diseases. The gut microbiota during pregnancy is
      also different between women with high or low gestational weight gain. Our study 
      demonstrates the structure, gestational age-associated variation, and
      associations with host factors of the gut microbiota during pregnancy and
      strengthens the understanding of microbe-host interactions. The results from this
      study offer new materials and prospects for gut microbiome research in clinical
      and diagnostic fields.

AB  - The composition of the bacterial community of Grana Padano (GP) cheese was
      evaluated by an amplicon-based metagenomic approach (DNA metabarcoding) and
      RAPD-PCR fingerprinting. One hundred eighteen cheeses, which included 118 dairies
      located in the production area of GP, were collected. Two hundred fifty-four OTUs
      were detected, of which 82 were further discriminated between dominant (32 OTUs; 
      > 1% total reads) and subdominant (50 OTUs; between 0.1% and 1% total reads)
      taxa. Lactobacillus (L.) delbrueckii, Lacticaseibacillus (Lact.) rhamnosus, Lact.
      casei, Limosilactobacillus fermentum, Lactococcus (Lc.) raffinolactis, L.
      helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lc. lactis were the major dominant
      taxa ('core microbiota'). The origin of samples significantly impacted on both
      richness, evenness, and the relative abundance of bacterial species, with
      peculiar pattern distribution among the five GP production regions. A
      differential analysis allowed to find bacterial species significantly associated 
      with specific region pairings. The analysis of pattern similarity among RAPD-PCR 
      profiles highlighted the presence of a 'core' community banding pattern present
      in all the GP samples, which was strictly associated with the core microbiota
      highlighted by DNA metabarcoding. A trend to group samples according to the five 
      production regions was also observed. This study widened our knowledge on the
      bacterial composition and ecology of Grana Padano cheese.

AB  - The root microbiome plays a key role that can influence host plant growth and
      abiotic stress. While there has been extensive characterization of community
      structure, spatial compartmentalization, and the impact of drought stresses on
      the root microbiome in rice and other plants, there is relatively little known
      about the differences in root microbiome among rice ecotypes in natural upland
      and lowland fields. Herein, we used two rice ecotypes, upland and irrigated
      ecotype rice (two Indica and two Japonica genotypes), as a model to explore the
      responses of the root microbiome under different environmental conditions. We
      aimed to identify environment-induced adaptation in the root bacterial and fungal
      composition of rice ecotypes by high-throughput sequencing. Rice from lowland
      field or upland had significantly altered overall bacterial and fungal community 
      compositions of the two ecotypes, with diversity of both ecotypes greatly
      decreased from lowland field to upland. The overall response of the root
      microbiome to upland conditions was taxonomically driven by the enrichment of
      family Enterobacteriaceae and genera Serratia, and phylum Ascomycota.
      Interestingly, rice ecotypes specifically enriched root microbes when they were
      transferred from their original environment, such as the enrichment of class
      Thermoleophilia and phylum Actinobacteria when the irrigated ecotype rice was
      moved from lowland to upland field. These results revealed that different
      environmental conditions and rice ecotypes resulted in a restructuring of root
      microbiome communities, and suggested the possibility that components responsible
      for the beneficial attributes in the altered root microbiome might contribute to 
      the adaptation of different ecotypes in natural fields.

TI  - The Microbiome of Neotropical Water Striders and Its Potential Role in
      Codiversification.

LID - 10.3390/insects11090578 [doi]
AB  - Insects host a highly diverse microbiome, which plays a crucial role in insect
      life. However, the composition and diversity of microbiomes associated with
      Neotropical freshwater insects is virtually unknown. In addition, the extent to
      which diversification of this microbiome is associated with host phylogenetic
      divergence remains to be determined. Here, we present the first comprehensive
      analysis of bacterial communities associated with six closely related species of 
      Neotropical water striders in Panama. We used comparative phylogenetic analyses
      to assess associations between dominant bacterial linages and phylogenetic
      divergence among species of water striders. We found a total of 806 16S rRNA
      amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), with dominant bacterial taxa belonging to the 
      phyla Proteobacteria (76.87%) and Tenericutes (19.51%). Members of the alpha-
      (e.g., Wolbachia) and gamma- (e.g., Acinetobacter, Serratia) Proteobacteria, and 
      Mollicutes (e.g., Spiroplasma) were predominantly shared across species,
      suggesting the presence of a core microbiome in water striders. However, some
      bacterial lineages (e.g., Fructobacillus, Fluviicola and Chryseobacterium) were
      uniquely associated with different water strider species, likely representing a
      distinctive feature of each species' microbiome. These findings indicate that
      both host identity and environmental context are important drivers of microbiome 
      diversity in water striders. In addition, they suggest that diversification of
      the microbiome is associated with diversification in water striders. Although
      more research is needed to establish the evolutionary consequences of
      host-microbiome interaction in water striders, our findings support recent work
      highlighting the role of bacterial community host-microbiome codiversification.

TI  - In-depth prospection of Avene Thermal Spring Water reveals an uncommon and stable
      microbial community.
PG  - 8-14
LID - 10.1111/jdv.16599 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Avene Thermal Spring Water (TSW) exhibits therapeutic properties in
      the treatment of skin pathologies. Arising from a dolomitic aquifer system, its
      physico-chemical properties are well-established and its bacteriological quality 
      regularly monitored. The microbiota of this aquifer have been characterized.
      OBJECTIVES: We aimed to describe the structure of the bacterial community
      inhabiting the deep aquifer and to examine its dynamics over time. METHODS: The
      Avene TSW was collected at the catchment point and filtered through 0.1 microm
      pore size filters. The sampling was carried out every 3 months to generate a
      4-year time series. The DNA extracted from filters was analysed using
      high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and the microorganisms and
      their contribution were characterized by the taxonomic assignment of sequence
      variants generated from each sample. RESULTS: Bacteria were distributed into 39
      phyla. Nitrospirae and Proteobacteria were the most prevalent, accounting for 38%
      and 23% of the total community on average, respectively. A stable pattern was
      observed throughout the study. A few bacterial species were always detected,
      forming a core community of likely chemolithoautotrophic organisms which might
      use energy sources and nutrients produced from water-bedrock interactions. Most
      of the species were distantly related to organisms described to date.
      CONCLUSIONS: Avene TSW provided by the deep aquifer system harbours a unique
      microbial community, shaped by the physico-chemical characteristics of the deep
      environment. Its remarkable stability over time has revealed a high level of
      confinement of the water resource.

TI  - Germ-Free Conditions Modulate Host Purine Metabolism, Exacerbating
      Adenine-Induced Kidney Damage.
LID - E547 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxins12090547 [doi]
AB  - Alterations in microbiota are known to affect kidney disease conditions. We have 
      previously shown that germ-free conditions exacerbated adenine-induced kidney
      damage in mice; however, the mechanism by which this occurs has not been
      elucidated. To explore this mechanism, we examined the influence of germ-free
      conditions on purine metabolism and renal immune responses involved in the kidney
      damage. Germ-free mice showed higher expression levels of purine-metabolizing
      enzymes such as xanthine dehydrogenase, which converts adenine to a nephrotoxic
      byproduct 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (2,8-DHA). The germ-free mice also showed
      increased urinary excretion of allantoin, indicating enhanced purine metabolism. 
      Metabolome analysis demonstrated marked differences in the purine metabolite
      levels in the feces of germ-free mice and mice with microbiota. Furthermore,
      unlike the germ-free condition, antibiotic treatment did not increase the
      expression of purine-metabolizing enzymes or exacerbate adenine-induced kidney
      damage. Considering renal immune responses, the germ-free mice displayed an
      absence of renal IL-17A expression. However, the adenine-induced kidney damage in
      wild-type mice was comparable to that in IL-17A-deficient mice, suggesting that
      IL-17A does not play a major role in the disease condition. Our results suggest
      that the enhanced host purine metabolism in the germ-free mice potentially
      promotes the conversion of the administered adenine into 2,8-DHA, resulting in
      exacerbated kidney damage. This further suggests a role of the microbiota in
      regulating host purine metabolism.

TI  - Microbial Communities of Stored Product Mites: Variation by Species and
      Population.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-020-01581-y [doi]
AB  - Arthropod-associated microorganisms are important because they affect host
      fitness, protect hosts from pathogens, and influence the host's ability to vector
      pathogens. Stored product mites (Astigmata) often establish large populations in 
      various types of food items, damaging the food by direct feeding and introducing 
      contaminants, including their own bodies, allergen-containing feces, and
      associated microorganisms. Here we access the microbial structure and abundance
      in rearing diets, eggs, feces fraction, and mite bodies of 16 mite populations
      belonging to three species (Carpoglyphus lactis, Acarus siro, and Tyrophagus
      putrescentiae) using quantitative PCR and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon 
      sequencing. The mite microbiomes had a complex structure dominated by the
      following bacterial taxa (OTUs): (a) intracellular symbionts of the genera
      Cardinium and Wolbachia in the mite bodies and eggs; (b) putative gut symbionts
      of the genera Solitalea, Bartonella, and Sodalis abundant in mite bodies and also
      present in mite feces; (c) feces-associated or environmental bacteria of the
      genera Bacillus, Staphylococcus, and Kocuria in the diet, mite bodies, and feces.
      Interestingly and counterintuitively, the differences between microbial
      communities in various conspecific mite populations were higher than those
      between different mite species. To explain some of these differences, we
      hypothesize that the intracellular bacterial symbionts can affect microbiome
      composition in mite bodies, causing differences between microbial profiles.
      Microbial profiles differed between various sample types, such as mite eggs,
      bodies, and the environment (spent growth medium-SPGM). Low bacterial abundances 
      in eggs may result in stochastic effects in parent-offspring microbial
      transmission, except for the intracellular symbionts. Bacteria in the rearing
      diet had little effect on the microbial community structure in SPGM and mite
      bodies. Mite fitness was positively correlated with bacterial abundance in SPGM
      and negatively correlated with bacterial abundances in mite bodies. Our study
      demonstrates critical host-microbe interactions, affecting all stages of mite
      growth and leading to alteration of the environmental microbiome. Correlational
      evidence based on absolute quantitation of bacterial 16S rRNA gene copies
      suggests that mite-associated microorganisms are critical for modulating
      important pest properties of mites by altering population growth.

AB  - Host-associated microbiomes can be critical for the health and proper development
      of animals and plants. The answers to many fundamental questions regarding the
      modes of acquisition and microevolution of microbiome communities remain to be
      established. Deciphering strain-level dynamics is essential to fully understand
      how microbial communities evolve, but the forces shaping the strain-level
      dynamics of microbial communities remain largely unexplored, mostly because of
      methodological issues and cost. Here, we used targeted strain-level deep
      sequencing to uncover the strain dynamics within a host-associated microbial
      community using the honey bee gut microbiome as a model system. Our results
      revealed that amplicon sequencing of conserved protein-coding gene regions using 
      species-specific primers is a cost-effective and accurate method for exploring
      strain-level diversity. In fact, using this method we were able to confirm
      strain-level results that have been obtained from whole-genome shotgun sequencing
      of the honey bee gut microbiome but with a much higher resolution. Importantly,
      our deep sequencing approach allowed us to explore the impact of low-frequency
      strains (i.e., cryptic strains) on microbiome dynamics. Results show that cryptic
      strain diversity is not responsible for the observed variations in microbiome
      composition across bees. Altogether, the findings revealed new fundamental
      insights regarding strain dynamics of host-associated microbiomes.IMPORTANCE The 
      factors driving fine-scale composition and dynamics of gut microbial communities 
      are poorly understood. In this study, we used metagenomic amplicon deep
      sequencing to decipher the strain dynamics of two key members of the honey bee
      gut microbiome. Using this high-throughput and cost-effective approach, we were
      able to confirm results from previous large-scale whole-genome shotgun (WGS)
      metagenomic sequencing studies while also gaining additional insights into the
      community dynamics of two core members of the honey bee gut microbiome. Moreover,
      we were able to show that cryptic strains are not responsible for the observed
      variations in microbiome composition across bees.

TI  - IL-13 as Target to Reduce Cholestasis and Dysbiosis in Abcb4 Knockout Mice.
LID - E1949 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells9091949 [doi]
AB  - The Th2 cytokine IL-13 is involved in biliary epithelial injury and liver
      fibrosis in patients as well as in animal models. The aim of this study was to
      investigate IL-13 as a therapeutic target during short term and chronic
      intrahepatic cholestasis in an Abcb4-knockout mouse model (Abcb4(-/-)). Lack of
      IL-13 protected Abcb4(-/-) mice transiently from cholestasis. This decrease in
      serum bile acids was accompanied by an enhanced excretion of bile acids and a
      normalization of fecal bile acid composition. In Abcb4(-/-)/IL-13(-/-) double
      knockout mice, bacterial translocation to the liver was significantly reduced and
      the intestinal microbiome resembled the commensal composition in wild type
      animals. In addition, 52-week-old Abcb4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) mice showed significantly 
      reduced hepatic fibrosis. Abcb4(-/-) mice devoid of IL-13 transiently improved
      cholestasis and converted the composition of the gut microbiota towards healthy
      conditions. This highlights IL-13 as a potential therapeutic target in biliary
      diseases.

TI  - Gut Microbiota of Five Sympatrically Farmed Marine Fish Species in the Aegean
      Sea.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-020-01580-z [doi]
AB  - In this study, we hypothesized that sympatrically grown farmed fish, i.e. fish
      which experience similar environmental conditions and nutritionally similar
      diets, would have more convergent gut microbiota. Using a "common garden"
      approach, we identified the core microbiota and bacterial community structure
      differences between five fish species farmed in the same aquaculture site on the 
      west coast of the Aegean Sea, Greece. The investigated individuals were at
      similar developmental stages and reared in adjacent (< 50 m) aquaculture cages;
      each cage had 15 kg fish m(-3). The diets were nutritionally similar to support
      optimal growth for each fish species. DNA from the midgut of 3-6 individuals per 
      fish species was extracted and sequenced for the V3-V4 region of the bacterial
      16S rRNA. Only 3.9% of the total 181 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were
      shared among all fish. Between 5 and 74 OTUs were unique to each fish species.
      Each of the investigated fish species had a distinct profile of dominant OTUs,
      i.e. cumulative relative abundance of >/= 80%. Co-occurrence network analysis for
      each fish species showed that all networks were strongly dominated by positive
      correlations between the abundances of their OTUs. However, each fish species had
      different network characteristics suggesting the differential significance of the
      OTUs in each of the five fish species midgut. The results of the present study
      may provide evidence that adult fish farmed in the Mediterranean Sea have a
      rather divergent and species-specific gut microbiota profile, which are shaped
      independently of the similar environmental conditions under which they grow.

AB  - Global amphibian declines due to the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium
      dendrobatidis (Bd) have led to questions about how amphibians defend themselves
      against skin diseases. A total of two amphibian defense mechanisms are
      antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), a component of amphibian innate immune defense and
      symbiotic skin bacteria, which can act in synergy. We characterized components of
      these factors in four populations of Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris)
      to investigate their role in disease defense. We surveyed the ability of their
      AMPs to inhibit Bd, skin bacterial community composition, skin metabolite
      profiles and presence and intensity of Bd infection. We found that AMPs from R.
      luteiventris inhibited Bd in bioassays, but inhibition did not correlate with Bd 
      intensity on frogs. R. luteiventris had two prevalent and abundant core bacteria:
      Rhizobacter and Chryseobacterium. Rhizobacter relative abundance was negatively
      correlated with AMP's ability to inhibit Bd, but was not associated with Bd
      status itself. There was no relationship between metabolites and Bd. Bacterial
      communities and Bd differ by location, which suggests a strong environmental
      influence. R. luteiventris are dominated by consistent core bacteria, but also
      house transient bacteria that are site specific. Our emergent hypothesis is that 
      host control and environmental factors shape the microbiota on R. luteiventris.

AB  - Microbial colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract of newly hatched chicks
      starts at hatch, seeded from the immediate hatching environment, and quickly
      results in dense colonisation. The role of ecological factors in gut colonisation
      has been extensively investigated, as well as the role of micro- and
      macronutrients in supporting and selecting for bacterial species highly adapted
      for utilising those nutrients. However, the microbial community contained in
      poultry feed and its influence on colonisation and maturation of gut microbiota
      has not been directly addressed. In this study, we compared the microbiota found 
      in poultry feed, with the microbiota of ileum, cecum and excreta, to identify
      substantial overlap in core microbiotas of the compared groups. We then
      investigated the microbiota present in raw feedstuffs: meat and bone meal, wheat,
      corn, canola, barley, soybean, millrun, sorghum, poultry oil, oats, limestone and
      bloodmeal from four geographically distinct feedstuff suppliers. Each of the
      feedstuffs had diverse microbial communities. The meat and bone meal and
      bloodmeal samples had the most complex and distinct microbial populations. There 
      was substantial overlap in the phylogenetic composition found in the grain and
      seed samples: barley, canola, corn, millrun, oats, sorghum, soybean meal and
      wheat. Issues related to methodology, viability of microbial communities in the
      gut and feed, and the implications for biosecurity are discussed.

AB  - Chinese milk vetch is an efficient approach to reduce Cd accumulation in rice,
      nevertheless, its reduction mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we
      investigated the rice grain Cd, soil properties and microbial community in a
      Cd-polluted paddy field amended with milk vetch residue (MV) or without (CK)
      during rice growth period. We found that milk vetch residue averagely decreased
      the Cd content in rice grain by 45%. Decrease of Cd in rice mainly attributed to 
      the inhibition of Cd activation by milk vetch residue at heading stage probably
      by the formation of HA-Cd (Humic Acid) and CdS. Increased pH and organic matter
      (OM) promoted the reduction of available Cd. In addition, nonmetric
      multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis revealed that microbial community
      structure was significantly different between MV and CK treatment (r = 0.187, p =
      0.002), and the core functions of differentially abundant genera were mainly
      associated with N-cycling, organic matter degradation and sulfate-reducing. The
      application of milk vetch residue increased the abundance of sulfate-reducing
      bacteria (SRB) by 8-112% during the rice growth period, which may involve in
      promoting the transformation of Cd to a more stably residual Cd (CdS). Canonical 
      correspondence analysis (CCA) and mantel test analysis indicated that available K
      (p = 0.004) and available N (p = 0.005) were the key environmental factors of
      shaping the SRB. Altogether, changes in soil properties affected microbial
      structure and functional characteristics, especially the response of SRB in MV
      treatment would provide valuable insights into reducing the bioavailability of Cd
      in soil.

AB  - It has been well acknowledged that the gut microbiome is important for host
      health, composition changes in these microbial communities might increase
      susceptibility to infections and reduce adaptability to environment.
      Reintroduction, as an effective strategy for wild population recovery and genetic
      diversity maintenance for endangered populations, usually takes captive
      populations as rewilding resource. While, little is known about the compositional
      and functional differences of gut microbiota between captive and wild
      populations, especially for large carnivores, like Amur tiger. In this study,
      high throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene (amplicon
      sequencing) and metagenomics were used to analyze the composition and function
      variations of gut microbiota communities between captive and wild Amur tiger
      populations based on total 35 fecal samples (13 from captive tigers and 22 from
      wild tigers). Our results showed that captive Amur tigers have higher alpha
      diversity in gut microbiota, but that the average unweighted UniFrac distance of 
      bacterial taxa among wild Amur tigers was much larger. The function differences
      involve most aspects of the body functions, especially for metabolism,
      environmental information processing, cellular processes, and organismal systems.
      It was indicated that the diet habit and environment difference between captive
      and wild populations lead to composition differences of gut microbiota and then
      resulted in significant differences in functions. These contrasts of functional
      and compositional variations in gut microbiota between wild and captive Amur
      tigers are essential insights for guiding conservation management and policy
      decision-making, and call for more attention on the influence of gut microbiota
      on the ability of captive animals to survive in the wild.

AB  - Gut microbiota is the collection of microbes that lives in the host. Glycan is
      the major factor to shape the composition of microbial community. Nostoc
      sphaeroids Kutz (NSK) has been used as food and medicine for thousands of years
      in Asian countries while the bioactivity on gut microbiota is unclear till now.
      Here, we used NSK polysaccharide and NSK powder to investigate the bioactivity on
      the gut microbiota of C57BL/6j mice, respectively. By 16S ribosomal RNA gene
      sequencing, we found the composition of gut microbiota had been changed and
      differed from each other. However, the abundance of Bacteroides, Parabacteroides,
      Escherichia-Shigella and Parasutterella on genus level were significantly
      increased by NSK polysaccharide and NSK powder. In addition, Akkermansia and
      Rikenellaceae were enriched by NSK powder. Moreover, we found the IL-1beta and
      IL-6 decreased significantly while TNF-alpha and IL-10 increased significantly
      especially in NSK powder group. Intriguingly, the increased microbes were
      significantly positively co-related with TNF-alpha and IL-10 while negatively
      co-related with IL-1beta and IL-6 by co-relation and network analysis. The above 
      results suggested that Nostoc sphaeroids Kutz may selectively enrich a "core
      bacterial community" and add new evidence to discover how Nostoc sphaeroids Kutz 
      has biological function.

TI  - A new Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing-based method for evaluating the
      composition of the Bacteroides community in the intestine using the rpsD gene
      sequence.
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.13651 [doi]
AB  - Bacteroides is a bacterial genus that is known to closely interact with the host.
      The potential role of this genus is associated with its ecological status and
      distribution in the intestine. However, the current 16S V3-V4 region sequencing
      method can only detect the abundance of this genus, revealing a need for a novel 
      sequencing method that can elucidate the composition of Bacteroides in the human 
      gut microbiota. In this study, a core gene, rpsD, was selected as a template for 
      the design of a Bacteroides-specific primer set. We used this primer set to
      develop a novel assay based on the Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform that
      enabled an accurate assessment of the Bacteroides compositions in complex
      samples. Known amounts of genomic DNA from 10 Bacteroides species were mixed with
      a complex sample and used to evaluate the performance and detection limit of our 
      assay. The results were highly consistent with those of direct sequencing with a 
      low Bacteroides DNA detection threshold (0.01 ng), supporting the reliability of 
      our assay. In addition, the assay could detect all the known Bacteroides species 
      within the faecal sample. In summary, we provide a sensitive and specific
      approach to determining the Bacteroides species in complex samples.

      alterations in the airway and gut related to mite-specific IgE responses in young
      children with airway allergies. This study enrolled 60 children, including 38
      mite-sensitized children (20 rhinitis and 18 asthma), and 22 non-mite-sensitized 
      healthy controls. Microbiome composition analysis of the throat swab and stool
      samples was performed using bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing. An integrative
      analysis of the airway and stool microbial profiling associated with IgE
      reactions in childhood allergic rhinitis and asthma was examined. The Chao1 and
      Shannon indices in the airway were significantly lower than those in the stool.
      Additionally, an inverse association of the airway microbial diversity with house
      dust mite (HDM) sensitization and allergic airway diseases was noted. Fecal IgE
      levels were positively correlated with the serum Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus- 
      and Dermatophagoides farinae-specific IgE levels. Airway Leptotrichia spp.
      related to asthma were strongly correlated with fecal Dorea and Ruminococcus
      spp., which were inversely associated with fecal IgE levels and risk of allergic 
      rhinitis. Moreover, four airway genera, Campylobacter, Selenomonas, Tannerella,
      and Atopobium, were negatively correlated with both serum mite-specific and fecal
      IgE levels. Among them, the airway Selenomonas and Atopobium spp. were positively
      correlated with stool Blautia and Dorea spp. related to asthma and allergic
      rhinitis, respectively. In conclusion, airway microbial dysbiosis in response to 
      HDM and its cross-talk with the gut microbial community is related to allergic
      airway diseases in early childhood.

AB  - The study aimed to explore the bacterial community composition and the functions 
      of core microbiota in Eucommia ulmoides bark. The bark samples of E. ulmoides
      were collected from Wangcang Sichuan Province, Cili Hunan Province, and Zunyi
      Guizhou Province, in China, respectively. Through the high-throughput sequencing 
      methods and techniques, the community composition, core microbiota, and function 
      of the bacteria were studied. The bacterial community of E. ulmoides bark
      consisted of 9 phyla, 11 classes, 22 orders, 28 families, 31 genera, and 37 OTUs.
      At the genus level, the dominant genus was the unclassified bacteria of
      Cyanobacteria, with a relative abundance of 97.01%. The bacterial communities of 
      E. ulmoides bark from different areas have their unique units except for the
      common microbiota. The core microbiota of bacteria included an unclassified genus
      of Cyanobacteria, an unclassified genus of Mitochondria, Pseudomonas,
      Sphingobium, Rhizobium, Novosphingobium, Enterobacter, Rhodococcus,
      Curtobacterium, and Ralstonia. FAPROTAX function prediction suggested that the
      core microbiota has a substantial potential for photoautotrophy, phototrophy,
      aerobic chemoheterotrophy, chemoheterotrophy. Ten taxa composed the core
      microbiota, and the majority of them were related to the pharmacologically active
      ingredients of E. ulmoides bark. The research provides a scientific basis for the
      biological marker of genuineness and microbial technology for improving the
      content of medicinal ingredients of E. ulmoides.

TI  - Microbiota in the Rhizosphere and Seed of Rice From China, With Reference to
      Their Transmission and Biogeography.
PG  - 995
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00995 [doi]
AB  - Seeds play key roles in the acquisition of plant pioneer microbiota, including
      the transmission of microbes from parent plants to offspring. However, the issues
      about seed microbial communities are mostly unknown, especially for their
      potential origins and the factors influencing the structure and composition. In
      this study, samples of rice seed and rhizosphere were collected from northeast
      and central-south China in two harvest years and analyzed using a metabarcoding
      approach targeting 16S rRNA gene region. A higher level of vertical transmission 
      (from parent seed microbiota to offspring) was revealed, as compared to the
      acquisition from the rhizosphere (25.5 vs 10.7%). The core microbiota of the rice
      seeds consisted of a smaller proportion of OTUs (3.59%) than that of the rice
      rhizosphere (7.54%). Among the core microbiota, species in Arthrobacter,
      Bacillus, Blastococcus, Curtobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Ramlibacter have been
      reported as potential pathogens and/or beneficial bacteria for plants. Both the
      seed and the rhizosphere of rice showed distance-decay of similarity in microbial
      communities. Seed moisture and winter mean annual temperature (WMAT) had
      significant impacts on seed microbiota, while WMAT, total carbon, available
      potassium, available phosphorus, aluminum, pH, and total nitrogen significantly
      determined the rhizosphere microbiota. Multiple functional pathways were found to
      be enriched in the seed or the rhizosphere microbiota, which, to some extent,
      explained the potential adaptation of bacterial communities to respective living 
      habitats. The results presented here elucidate the composition and possible
      sources of rice seed microbiota, which is crucial for the health and productivity
      management in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - This study describes the community composition and functions of the gut
      microbiome of the freshwater omnivorous pufferfish based on metagenomic approach.
      Metagenome sequence data showed a dominance of the class Gammaproteobacteria
      followed by Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, Anerolineae, Betaproteobacteria,
      Deinococci, Clostridia and Deltaproteobacteria. At the order level, the most
      abundant groups were Aeromonadales, Fusobacteriales, Enterobacterales,
      Synechococcales. The genus Aeromonas was the most predominant followed by
      Plesiomonas and Cetobacterium. Additionally, within the domain Archaea, class
      Methanomicrobia was most abundant followed by Hadesarchaea, Thermoplasmata,
      Candidatus Altiarchaeales, Candidatus Bathyarchaeota and Thermoprotei. The
      metabolic profile of the bacterial community exhibited a high prevalence of genes
      associated with core housekeeping functions, such as synthesis of cofactors,
      vitamins, prosthetic groups, pigments, amino acids and its derivatives,
      carbohydrate and protein metabolism. Comparative analysis with other fish gut
      microbiome showing similarity in protein metabolism with carnivorous Salmon and
      carbohydrate metabolism with herbivorous grass carp respectively. This study
      describes the bacterial community compositions are influenced by the trophic
      level.

TI  - The Beta-Diversity of Siganus fuscescens-Associated Microbial Communities From
      Different Habitats Increases With Body Weight.
PG  - 1562
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.01562 [doi]
AB  - Fish-associated microbial communities play important roles in host growth, health
      and disease in the symbiont ecosystem; however, their diversity patterns and
      underlying mechanisms in different body habitats remain poorly understood.
      Siganus fuscescens is one of the most important consumers of macroalgae and an
      excellent natural marine source of nutritional lipids for humans, and widely
      distributes in shallow coastal areas. Here we systematically studied the
      microbial communities of 108 wild S. fuscescens in four body habitats (i.e.,
      skin, gill, stomach, and hindgut) and surrounding water. We found that the
      beta-diversity but not alpha-diversity of fish-associated microbial communities
      from each habitat significantly (p < 0.05) increased as body weight increased.
      Also, opportunistic pathogens and probiotics (e.g., Pseudomongs,
      Methylobacterium) appeared to be widely distributed in different body habitats,
      and many digestive bacteria (e.g., Clostridium) in the hindgut; the abundances of
      some core OTUs associated with digestive bacteria, "Anaerovorax" (OTU_6 and
      OTU_46724) and "Holdemania" (OTU_33295) in the hindgut increased as body weight
      increased. Additionally, the quantification of ecological processes indicated
      that heterogeneous selection was the major process (46-70%) governing the
      community assembly of fish microbiomes, whereas the undominated process (64%) was
      found to be more important for the water microbiome. The diversity pattern showed
      that beta-diversity (75%) of the metacommunity overweight the alpha-diversity
      (25%), confirming that the niche separation of microbial communities in different
      habitats and host selection were important to shape the fish-associated microbial
      community structure. This study enhances our mechanistic understanding of
      fish-associated microbial communities in different habitats, and has important
      implications for analyzing host-associated metacommunities.

TI  - Host Genetic Factors Associated with Vaginal Microbiome Composition in Kenyan
      Women.
LID - e00502-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00502-20 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) affects 20% of women worldwide and is associated with
      adverse reproductive health outcomes and increased risk for HIV. Typically, BV
      represents a shift in the vaginal microbiome from one that is dominated by
      Lactobacillus to one that is diverse. Persistent racial differences in BV and
      diverse vaginal microbiome composition overlap with racial disparities in risks
      for HIV and sexually transmitted infection, especially among women of African
      descent. Risk factors for BV and nonoptimal vaginal microbiome include sexual
      practices, yet racial differences persist when adjusted for behavioral factors,
      suggesting a host genetic component. Here, we perform a genome-wide association
      study on vaginal microbiome traits in Kenyan women. Linear regression and
      logistic regression were performed, adjusting for age and principal components of
      genetic ancestry, to evaluate the association between Lactobacillus crispatus,
      Lactobacillus iners, Gardnerella vaginalis, Shannon diversity index, and
      community state type (CST) with host genetic single nucleotide polymorphisms
      (SNPs). We identified novel genomic loci associated with the vaginal microbiome
      traits, though no SNP reached genome-wide significance. During pathway enrichment
      analysis, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), cytokine production, and other components
      of innate immune response were associated with L. crispatus, L. iners, and CST.
      Multiple previously reported genomic loci were replicated, including IL-8
      (Shannon, CST), TIRAP (L. iners, Shannon), TLR2 (Shannon, CST), MBL2 (L. iners,
      G. vaginalis, CST), and MYD88 (L. iners, Shannon). These genetic associations
      suggest a role for the innate immune system and cell signaling in vaginal
      microbiome composition and susceptibility to nonoptimal vaginal
      microbiome.IMPORTANCE Globally, bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common condition in
      women. BV is associated with poorer reproductive health outcomes and HIV risk.
      Typically, BV represents a shift in the vaginal microbiome from one that is
      dominated by Lactobacillus to one that is diverse. Despite many women having
      similar exposures, the prevalence of BV and nonoptimal vaginal microbiome is
      increased for women of African descent, suggesting a possible role for host
      genetics. We conducted a genome-wide association study of important vaginal
      microbiome traits in Kenyan women. We identified novel genetic loci and
      biological pathways related to mucosal immunity, cell signaling, and infection
      that were associated with vaginal microbiome traits; we replicated previously
      reported loci associated with mucosal immune response. These results provide
      insight into potential host genetic influences on vaginal microbiome composition 
      and can guide larger longitudinal studies, with genetic and functional comparison
      across microbiome sites within individuals and across populations.

      invincible.

AB  - The human microbiome is a mysterious treasure of the body playing endless
      important roles in the well-being of the host metabolism, digestion, and
      immunity. On the other hand, it actively participates in the development of a
      variety of pathological conditions including cancer. With the Human Microbiome
      Project initiative, metagenomics, and next-generation sequencing technologies in 
      place, the last decade has witnessed immense explorations and investigations on
      the enigmatic association of breast cancer with the human microbiome. However,
      the connection between the human microbiome and breast cancer remains to be
      explored in greater detail. In fact, there are several emerging questions such as
      whether the host microbiota contributes to disease initiation, or is it a
      consequence of the disease is an irrevocably important question that demands a
      valid answer. Since the microbiome is an extremely complex community, gaps still 
      remain on how this vital microbial organ plays a role in orchestrating breast
      cancer development. Nevertheless, undeniable evidence from studies has pinpointed
      the presence of specific microbial elements of the breast and gut to play a role 
      in governing breast cancer. It is still unclear if an alteration in
      microbiome/dysbiosis leads to breast cancer or is it vice versa. Though specific 
      microbial signatures have been detected to be associated with various breast
      cancer subtypes, the structure and composition of a core "healthy" microbiome is 
      yet to be established. Probiotics seem to be a promising antidote for targeted
      prevention and treatment of breast cancer. Interestingly, these microbial
      communities can serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis, diagnosis, and
      treatment of breast cancer, thereby leading to the rise of a completely new era
      of personalized medicine. This review is a humble attempt to summarize the
      research findings on the human microbiome and its relation to breast cancer.

AB  - Background: A functional interplay between BAs and microbial composition in gut
      is a well-documented phenomenon. In bile, this phenomenon is far less studied,
      and with this report, we describe the interactions between the BAs and microbiota
      in this complex biological matrix. Methodology. Thirty-seven gallstone disease
      patients of which twenty-one with Opisthorchis felineus infection were enrolled
      in the study. The bile samples were obtained during laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
      for gallstone disease operative treatment. Common bile acid composition was
      measured by LC-MS/MS. Gallbladder microbiota were previously analyzed with 16S
      rRNA gene sequencing on Illumina MiSeq platform. The associations between bile
      acid composition and microbiota were analyzed. Results: Bile acid signature and
      Opisthorchis felineus infection status exert influence on beta-diversity of bile 
      microbial community. Direct correlations were found between taurocholic acid,
      taurochenodeoxycholic acid concentrations, and alpha-diversity of bile
      microbiota. Taurocholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid both show positive
      associations with the presence of Chitinophagaceae family, Microbacterium and
      Lutibacterium genera, and Prevotella intermedia. Also, direct associations were
      identified for taurocholic acid concentration and the presence of Actinomycetales
      and Bacteroidales orders, Lautropia genus, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and
      Haemophilus parainfluenzae as well as for taurochenodeoxycholic acid and
      Acetobacteraceae family and Sphingomonas genus. There were no differences in bile
      acid concentrations between O. felineus-infected and noninfected patients.
      Conclusions/Significance. Associations between diversity, taxonomic profile of
      bile microbiota, and bile acid levels were evidenced in patients with
      cholelithiasis. Increase of taurochenodeoxycholic acid and taurocholic acid
      concentration correlates with bile microbiota alpha-diversity and appearance of
      opportunistic pathogens.

TI  - A Novel Cecropin-LL37 Hybrid Peptide Protects Mice Against EHEC
      Infection-Mediated Changes in Gut Microbiota, Intestinal Inflammation, and
      Impairment of Mucosal Barrier Functions.
PG  - 1361
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2020.01361 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal inflammation can cause impaired epithelial barrier function and
      disrupt immune homeostasis, which increases the risks of developing many highly
      fatal diseases. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157:H7 causes
      intestinal infections worldwide and is a major pathogen that induces intestinal
      inflammation. Various antibacterial peptides have been described as having the
      potential to suppress and treat pathogen-induced intestinal inflammation.
      Cecropin A (1-8)-LL37 (17-30) (C-L), a novel hybrid peptide designed in our
      laboratory that combines the active center of C with the core functional region
      of L, shows superior antibacterial properties and minimized cytotoxicity compared
      to its parental peptides. Herein, to examine whether C-L could inhibit
      pathogen-induced intestinal inflammation, we investigated the anti-inflammatory
      effects of C-L in EHEC O157:H7-infected mice. C-L treatment improved the
      microbiota composition and microbial community balance in mouse intestines. The
      hybrid peptide exhibited improved anti-inflammatory effects than did the
      antibiotic, enrofloxacin. Hybrid peptide treated infected mice demonstrated
      reduced clinical signs of inflammation, reduced weight loss, reduced expression
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha),
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)], reduced apoptosis, and
      reduced markers of jejunal epithelial barrier function. The peptide also affected
      the MyD88-nuclear factor kappaB signaling pathway, thereby modulating
      inflammatory responses upon EHEC stimulation. Collectively, these findings
      suggest that the novel hybrid peptide C-L could be developed into a new
      anti-inflammatory agent for use in animals or humans.

TI  - The intestine of artificially bred larval turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) contains 
      a stable core group of microbiota.

AB  - Generally speaking, fish intestinal microbiota is easily affected by food or
      water environment, and it may be dynamically changed along with body growth.
      However, it remains unclear whether fish gut microbiota can be affected under any
      conditions. In the present study, we focused on cultured larval turbot
      (Scophthalmus maximus) and tracked its artificial breeding process from eggs to
      larvae in two farms located in different regions of China. Through continuous
      sampling, we analyzed and compared characteristics of intestinal microbiota in
      turbot larvae and its correlation with the bacteria in water and food at
      different developmental stages. The results showed that there was a steady group 
      of microbiota in larval gut, and the highest relative abundance of strain was
      same between the two farms. This microbiota was established soon after hatching
      of fertilized eggs. Particularly, the structure of this microbiota was nearly not
      changeable afterward 3-4 months of development. The bacteria carried by
      fertilized eggs might play an important role during the formation of this
      microbiota. In conclusion, our findings suggested that there was a core
      microbiota represented by Lactococcus sp. in gut of artificially bred turbot
      larvae. The relative proportion of such strain in gut was higher than 30% at the 
      initial stage of turbot life.

      Core Microbiomes.

AB  - Constructing biological communities is a major challenge in both basic and
      applied sciences. Although model synthetic communities with a few species have
      been constructed, designing systems consisting of tens or hundreds of species
      remains one of the most difficult goals in ecology and microbiology. By utilizing
      high-throughput sequencing data of interspecific association networks, we here
      propose a framework for exploring "functional core" species that have great
      impacts on whole community processes and functions. The framework allows us to
      score each species within a large community based on three criteria: namely,
      topological positions, functional portfolios, and functional balance within a
      target network. The criteria are measures of each species' roles in maximizing
      functional benefits at the community or ecosystem level. When species with
      potentially large contributions to ecosystem-level functions are screened, the
      framework also helps us design "functional core microbiomes" by focusing on
      properties of species groups (modules) within a network. When embedded into
      agroecosystems or human gut, such functional core microbiomes are expected to
      organize whole microbiome processes and functions. An application to a
      plant-associated microbiome dataset actually highlighted potential functional
      core microbes that were known to control rhizosphere microbiomes by suppressing
      pathogens. Meanwhile, an example of application in mouse gut microbiomes called
      attention to poorly investigated bacterial species, whose potential roles within 
      gut microbiomes deserve future experimental studies. The framework for gaining
      "bird's-eye" views of functional cores within networks is applicable not only to 
      agricultural and medical data but also to datasets produced in food processing,
      brewing, waste water purification, and biofuel production.

      Community Setting: Prevalence, Risk Factors, and Composition of Gut Microbiome.
PG  - 1402
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.01402 [doi]
AB  - Background: The prevalence of colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms
      (MDROs) among healthy adults in the community is largely unknown. This study
      investigated the colonization rate of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae,
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and vancomycin-resistant
      enterococci (VRE) in the community in Taiwan, and compared the gut microbiota
      between MDRO carriers and non-carriers. Methods: This prospective cohort study
      was conducted from March 2017 to February 2018 at the Hsin-Chu and Jin-Shan
      branches of National Taiwan University Hospital. Nasal swabs and stool samples
      were obtained from healthy adults attending a health examination to screen for
      MDROs. Bacteria isolates of MDROs were tested for antibiotic susceptibility and
      resistant genes. Relevant data were collected using a standardized questionnaire 
      to evaluate the risk factors for MDROs carriage, and 16S rRNA metagenomics
      sequencing was performed to analyze gut microbiota. Results: Among 187
      participants, 4.6% (8/174) carried MRSA and 41.4% (77/186) carried
      third-generation cephalosporin-resistant (3GC-R) Escherichia coli or Klebsiella
      pneumoniae. The carriage rate of AmpC beta-lactamases and ESBL-producing strains 
      were 16.1 and 27.4%, respectively. No carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
      (CRE) or VRE were detected. The dominant resistant gene of E. coli isolates was
      CTX-M-type (73%), while that of K. pneumoniae was AmpC beta-lactamases (80%). In 
      the multivariate analysis, the significant risk factors for carrying 3GC-R E.
      coli or K. pneumoniae were being an employee of technology company A [adjusted
      odds ratio (aOR) 4.127; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.824-9.336; p = 0.001], and
      traveling to Southeast Asia in the past year (aOR 6.545; 95% CI 1.071-40.001; p =
      0.042). The gut microbiota analysis showed that the phylum Proteobacteria and the
      family Enterobacteriaceae were significantly more abundant in 3GC-R E. coli and
      K. pneumoniae carriers. Conclusion: A high rate of Taiwanese adults in the
      community carried 3GC-R Enterobacteriaceae, while no CRE or VRE colonization was 
      noted. Compared with non-carriers, an expansion of Enterobacteriaceae in gut
      microbiota was found among 3GC-R Enterobacteriaceae carriers.

TI  - Metabarcoding Analyses of Gut Microbiota of Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) 
      from Lake Awassa and Lake Chamo, Ethiopia.

AB  - The Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) gut harbors a diverse microbial
      community; however, their variation across gut regions, lumen and mucosa is not
      fully elucidated. In this study, gut microbiota of all samples across gut regions
      and sample types (luminal content and mucosa) were analyzed and compared from two
      Ethiopian lakes. Microbiota were characterized using 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq
      platform sequencing. A total of 2061 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were
      obtained and the results indicated that Nile tilapia from Lake Chamo harbored a
      much more diversified gut microbiota than Lake Awassa. In addition, the gut
      microbiota diversity varied significantly across the gut region based on the
      Chao1, Shannon and Simpson index. The microbiome analyses of all samples in the
      midgut region showed significantly higher values for alpha diversity (Chao 1,
      Shannon and Simpson). Beta diversity analysis revealed a clear separation of
      samples according to sampling areas and gut regions. The most abundant genera
      were Clostridium_sensu_stricto and Clostridium_XI genera across all samples.
      Between the two sampling lakes, two phyla, Phylum Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria,
      were found to be significantly different. On the other hand, six phyla
      (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and
      Cyanobacteria) were significantly different across gut regions. In this study, we
      found that all samples shared a large core microbiota, comprising a relatively
      large number of OTUs, which was dominated by Proteobacteria, Firmicutes,
      Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria and Actinobacteria. This study has established the
      bases for future large-scale investigations of gut microbiota of fishes in
      Ethiopian lakes.

TI  - Biogeography of microbial bile acid transformations along the murine gut.
PG  - 1450-1463
LID - 10.1194/jlr.RA120001021 [doi]
AB  - Bile acids, which are synthesized from cholesterol by the liver, are chemically
      transformed along the intestinal tract by the gut microbiota, and the products of
      these transformations signal through host receptors, affecting overall host
      health. These transformations include bile acid deconjugation, oxidation, and
      7alpha-dehydroxylation. An understanding of the biogeography of bile acid
      transformations in the gut is critical because deconjugation is a prerequisite
      for 7alpha-dehydroxylation and because most gut microorganisms harbor bile acid
      transformation capacity. Here, we used a coupled metabolomic and metaproteomic
      approach to probe in vivo activity of the gut microbial community in a
      gnotobiotic mouse model. Results revealed the involvement of Clostridium scindens
      in 7alpha-dehydroxylation, of the genera Muribaculum and Bacteroides in
      deconjugation, and of six additional organisms in oxidation (the genera
      Clostridium, Muribaculum, Bacteroides, Bifidobacterium, Acutalibacter, and
      Akkermansia). Furthermore, the bile acid profile in mice with a more complex
      microbiota, a dysbiosed microbiota, or no microbiota was considered. For
      instance, conventional mice harbor a large diversity of bile acids, but treatment
      with an antibiotic such as clindamycin results in the complete inhibition of
      7alpha-dehydroxylation, underscoring the strong inhibition of organisms that are 
      capable of carrying out this process by this compound. Finally, a comparison of
      the hepatic bile acid pool size as a function of microbiota revealed that a
      reduced microbiota affects host signaling but not necessarily bile acid
      synthesis. In this study, bile acid transformations were mapped to the associated
      active microorganisms, offering a systematic characterization of the relationship
      between microbiota and bile acid composition.

TI  - Revealing the Impact of the Environment on Cistanche salsa: From Global
      Ecological Regionalization to Soil Microbial Community Characteristics.
PG  - 8720-8731
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.0c01568 [doi]
AB  - To understand the regulatory relationship between the environment and Cistanche
      salsa, here we integrated the macro- and microdimension methods. From a
      macroperspective, the MaxEnt model indicated that countries along the Belt and
      Road Initiative, such as China, Egypt, and Libya, were particularly suitable for 
      growth of C. salsa from ancient times (Last Glacial Maximum and mid-Holocene) to 
      the future (2050 and 2070). The Jackknife test revealed that precipitation is an 
      important ecological factor that affects C. salsa's distribution. From a
      microperspective, 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data showed that the soil
      microbial communities of three ecotypes (desert-steppe, grassland, and
      gravel-desert) were significantly different (p < 0.001). Core microbiome analysis
      demonstrated that the bacterial genera Arthrobacter, Sphingomonas, and Bacillus
      were enriched core taxa of C. salsa. LEfSe and random forest were used to
      excavate the Gillisia (desert-steppe), Flavisolibacter (grassland), and
      Variibacter (gravel-desert) as biomarkers that can distinguish among microbial
      communities from the three ecotypes. The prediction profile showed that the
      metabolic function of the microbial community was enriched in metabolic pathways 
      and environmental information processing. Correlation analyses revealed that the 
      altitude, precipitation of the warmest quarter (bio18), mean diurnal range
      (bio2), and mean temperature of the warmest quarter (bio10) were important
      ecological factors that affect the composition of soil microbial communities.
      This work provided new insights into the regulatory relationship among the
      suitable distribution of C. salsa, soil microbial communities, and ecological
      drivers. Moreover, it deepened the understanding of the interaction between
      desert plants and ecological factors in arid environments.

TI  - Reductive soil disinfestation incorporated with organic residue combination
      significantly improves soil microbial activity and functional diversity than sole
      residue incorporation.
PG  - 7573-7588

AB  - Reductive soil disinfestation (RSD) is an effective agricultural practice to
      eliminate soil-borne pathogens that heavily relies on the organic substrate used.
      However, the influences of combined application of organic residues on
      disinfestation efficiency, soil microbiomes, and their associated functional
      characteristics are still not well-characterized. In this work, four treatments, 
      i.e., untreated soil (CK), RSD with 15 t ha(-1) sugarcane bagasse (SB), bean
      dregs (BD), and their combinations (1:1, SB+BD), were conducted to investigate
      their influence on disinfestation efficiency, microbial functional diversity,
      community diversity, and composition using Biolog analysis, real-time PCR, and
      high-throughput sequencing. The SB+BD treatment had synergetic effects on soil
      microbial activity, metabolic activity, and functional diversity with similar
      efficacy in pathogen elimination and soil salinization alleviation, as compared
      to the SB and BD treatments. Moreover, the SB+BD treatment distinctly altered the
      structure and composition of bacterial and fungal communities, especially
      enriched the core microbiomes associated with soil general functions such as
      organic decomposition and nitrate removal. The SB+BD treatment also strengthened 
      the soil specific functions including disease suppression through the regulation 
      of unique microbiomes. In addition, the microbial richness, diversity, and
      evenness were significantly higher in the SB+BD-treated soil as compared to the
      SB- and BD-treated soils. Taken together, RSD incorporated with organic residue
      combination not only efficiently restore the degraded soils, but also
      considerably improve soil functions, which may benefit to the health for the
      future plant generations. KEY POINTS: * Organic residue combination effectively
      declines pathogen density. * Organic residue combination improves soil microbial 
      activity and functional diversity. * The enriched core microbiome is responsible 
      for soil general functions. * The induced unique microbiome is important for soil
      specific functions.

TI  - Microbial community analysis in the gills of abalones suggested possible
      dominance of epsilonproteobacterium in Haliotis gigantea.
PG  - e9326
LID - 10.7717/peerj.9326 [doi]
AB  - Gills are important organs for aquatic invertebrates because they harbor
      chemosynthetic bacteria, which fix inorganic carbon and/or nitrogen and provide
      their hosts with organic compounds. Nevertheless, in contrast to the intensive
      researches related to the gut microbiota, much is still needed to further
      understand the microbiota within the gills of invertebrates. Using abalones as a 
      model, we investigated the community structure of microbes associated with the
      gills of these invertebrates using next-generation sequencing. Molecular
      identification of representative bacterial sequences was performed using cloning,
      nested PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with specific
      primers or probes. We examined three abalone species, namely Haliotis gigantea,
      H. discus and H. diversicolor using seawater and stones as controls. Microbiome
      analysis suggested that the gills of all three abalones had the unclassified
      Spirochaetaceae (one OTU, 15.7 +/- 0.04%) and Mycoplasma sp. (one OTU, 9.1 +/-
      0.03%) as the core microbes. In most libraries from the gills of H. gigantea,
      however, a previously unknown epsilonproteobacterium species (one OTU) was
      considered as the dominant bacterium, which accounted for 62.2% of the relative
      abundance. The epsilonproteobacterium was only detected in the gills of H.
      diversicolor at 0.2% and not in H. discus suggesting that it may be unique to H. 
      gigantea. Phylogenetic analysis performed using a near full-length 16S rRNA gene 
      placed the uncultured epsilonproteobacterium species at the root of the family
      Helicobacteraceae. Interestingly, the uncultured epsilonproteobacterium was
      commonly detected from gill tissue rather than from the gut and foot tissues
      using a nested PCR assay with uncultured epsilonproteobacterium-specific primers.
      FISH analysis with the uncultured epsilonproteobacterium-specific probe revealed 
      that probe-reactive cells in H. gigantea had a coccus-like morphology and formed 
      microcolonies on gill tissue. This is the first report to show that
      epsilonproteobacterium has the potential to be a dominant species in the gills of
      the coastal gastropod, H. gigantea.

TI  - Longitudinal gut microbiome changes in alcohol use disorder are influenced by
      abstinence and drinking quantity.
PG  - 1608-1631
LID - 10.1080/19490976.2020.1758010 [doi]
AB  - Many patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) consume alcohol chronically and in 
      large amounts that alter intestinal microbiota, damage the gastrointestinal
      tract, and thereby injure other organs via malabsorption and intestinal
      inflammation. We hypothesized that alcohol consumption and subsequent abstinence 
      would change the gut microbiome in adults admitted to a treatment program. Stool 
      and oral specimens, diet data, gastrointestinal assessment scores, anxiety,
      depression measures and drinking amounts were collected longitudinally for up to 
      4 weeks in 22 newly abstinent inpatients with AUD who were dichotomized as less
      heavy drinkers (LHD, <10 drinks/d) and very heavy drinkers (VHD, 10 or more
      drinks/d). Next-generation 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to measure the
      gut and oral microbiome at up to ten time points/subject and LHD and VHD were
      compared for change in principal components, Shannon diversity index and specific
      genera. The first three principal components explained 46.7% of the variance in
      gut microbiome diversity across time and all study subjects, indicating the
      change in gut microbiome following abstinence. The first time point was an
      outlier in three-dimensional principal component space versus all other time
      points. The gut microbiota in LHD and VHD were significantly dissimilar in change
      from day 1 to day 5 (p = .03) and from day 1 to week 3 (p = .02). The VHD
      drinking group displayed greater change from baseline. The Shannon diversity
      index of the gut microbiome changed significantly during abstinence in five
      participants. In both groups, the Shannon diversity was lower in the oral
      microbiome than gut. Ten total genera were shared between oral and stool in the
      AUD participants. These data were compared with healthy controls from the Human
      Microbiome Project to investigate the concept of a core microbiome. Rapid changes
      in gut microbiome following abstinence from alcohol suggest resilience of the gut
      microbiome in AUD and reflects the benefits of refraining from the highest levels
      of alcohol and potential benefits of abstinence.

TI  - House dust microbiota in relation to adult asthma and atopy in a US farming
      population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial exposure from house dust has been associated with asthma
      and atopy in children but whether these relationships are present in adults
      remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We sought to examine associations of house dust
      microbiota with adult asthma, atopy, and hay fever. METHODS: Vacuumed bedroom
      dust samples from the homes of 879 participants (average age, 62 years) in the
      Agricultural Lung Health Study, a case-control study of asthma nested within a
      farming cohort, were subjected to 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize
      bacterial communities. We defined current asthma and hay fever using
      questionnaires and current atopy by blood specific IgE level > 0.70 IU/mL to 1 or
      more of 10 common allergens. We used linear regression to examine whether overall
      within-sample bacterial diversity differed by outcome, microbiome
      regression-based kernel association test to evaluate whether between-sample
      bacterial community compositions differed by outcome, and analysis of composition
      of microbiomes to identify differentially abundant bacterial taxa. RESULTS:
      Overall diversity of bacterial communities in house dust was similar by asthma
      status but was lower (P < .05) with atopy or hay fever. Many individual bacterial
      taxa were differentially abundant (false-discovery rate, <0.05) by asthma, atopy,
      or hay fever. Several taxa from Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria
      were more abundant with asthma, atopy, or hay fever. In contrast, several taxa
      from Firmicutes were more abundant in homes of individuals with adequately
      controlled asthma (vs inadequately controlled asthma), individuals without atopy,
      or individuals without hay fever. CONCLUSIONS: Microbial composition of house
      dust may influence allergic outcomes in adults.

AB  - Although seagrasses are economically and ecologically critical species, little is
      known about their blade surface microbial communities and how these communities
      relate to the plant host. To determine microbial community composition and
      diversity on seagrass blade surfaces and in the surrounding seawater,16S rRNA
      gene sequencing (iTag) was used for samples collected at five sites along a
      gradient of freshwater input in the northern Gulf of Mexico on three separate
      sampling dates. Additionally, seagrass surveys were performed and environmental
      parameters were measured to characterize host characteristics and the abiotic
      conditions at each site. Results showed that Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) 
      blades hosted unique microbial communities that were distinct in composition and 
      diversity from the water column. Environmental conditions, including water depth,
      salinity, and temperature, influenced community structure as blade surface
      microbial communities varied among sites and sampling dates in correlation with
      changes in environmental parameters. Microbial community composition also
      correlated with seagrass host characteristics, including growth rates and blade
      nutrient composition. There is some evidence for a core community for T.
      testudinum as 21 microorganisms from five phyla (Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria,
      Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes) were present in all blade surface
      samples. This study provides new insights and understanding of the processes that
      influence the structure of marine phyllosphere communities, how these microbial
      communities relate to their host, and their role as a part of the seagrass
      holobiont, which is an important contribution given the current decline of
      seagrass coverage worldwide.

AB  - Intestinal microbiota perform important functions for the health of fishes.
      Knowing the microbial composition and evaluating the possible effects caused by
      anthropogenic pollution in the intestinal microbiota of fish populations might
      represent an important step in defining microbial biomarkers for water pollution.
      This study evaluated the impact of environmental contamination on the gut
      microbiota of the livebearer killifish Phalloceros caudimaculatus. The 16S survey
      using the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to characterize and compare the
      microbiota of two P. caudimaculatus populations from streams with different
      levels of environmental contamination in Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. Twelve bacterial
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (around one-third of the total) were shared
      between both fish populations. They represent the core microbiota of the gut in
      this species. The dominant phyla were Protebacteria and Firmicutes, with more
      than 80% of relative abundance. The dominant genus was Burkholderia with more
      than 35% of the relative abundance irrespective of the environmental condition.
      We detected a lower microbial diversity (Shannon index and observed OTUs) in fish
      from the polluted stream compared to the reference stream. The PERMANOVA analysis
      showed that the intestinal microbial communities from fish living in the polluted
      stream were distinct from those found in the reference stream (p < 0.05).
      Finally, we identified Luteolibacter, Methylocaldum and Rhodobacter genera, which
      correlated strongly with the polluted stream. These taxa might represent
      potential microbial biomarkers of exposure to environmental contaminants in the
      guts of fish. Confirmation of these findings in other polluted environments might
      allow the development of a microbiota-based screening approach for environmental 
      evaluation in ecotoxicological studies in aquatic ecosystems.

PG  - 103

AB  - The field of microbiome research has evolved rapidly over the past few decades
      and has become a topic of great scientific and public interest. As a result of
      this rapid growth in interest covering different fields, we are lacking a clear
      commonly agreed definition of the term "microbiome." Moreover, a consensus on
      best practices in microbiome research is missing. Recently, a panel of
      international experts discussed the current gaps in the frame of the
      European-funded MicrobiomeSupport project. The meeting brought together about 40 
      leaders from diverse microbiome areas, while more than a hundred experts from all
      over the world took part in an online survey accompanying the workshop. This
      article excerpts the outcomes of the workshop and the corresponding online survey
      embedded in a short historical introduction and future outlook. We propose a
      definition of microbiome based on the compact, clear, and comprehensive
      description of the term provided by Whipps et al. in 1988, amended with a set of 
      novel recommendations considering the latest technological developments and
      research findings. We clearly separate the terms microbiome and microbiota and
      provide a comprehensive discussion considering the composition of microbiota, the
      heterogeneity and dynamics of microbiomes in time and space, the stability and
      resilience of microbial networks, the definition of core microbiomes, and
      functionally relevant keystone species as well as co-evolutionary principles of
      microbe-host and inter-species interactions within the microbiome. These broad
      definitions together with the suggested unifying concepts will help to improve
      standardization of microbiome studies in the future, and could be the starting
      point for an integrated assessment of data resulting in a more rapid transfer of 
      knowledge from basic science into practice. Furthermore, microbiome standards are
      important for solving new challenges associated with anthropogenic-driven changes
      in the field of planetary health, for which the understanding of microbiomes
      might play a key role. Video Abstract.

TI  - The Bacterial Gut Microbiota of Schoolchildren from High and Low Socioeconomic
      Status: A Study in an Urban Area of Makassar, Indonesia.
LID - E961 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8060961 [doi]
AB  - To understand the relationship between the gut microbiota and the health profile 
      of Indonesians, it is important to elucidate the characteristics of the bacterial
      communities that prevail in this population. To this end, we profiled the faecal 
      bacterial community of 140 Indonesian schoolchildren in urban Makassar. The core 
      microbiota of Indonesian schoolchildren consisted of Bifidobacterium,
      Collinsella, and multiple members of the Lachnospiraceae and Ruminicoccaceae
      families, but the relative abundance of these taxa varied greatly among children.
      Socioeconomic status (SES) was the main driver for differences in microbiota
      composition. Multiple bacterial genera were differentially abundant between high 
      and low SES children, including Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Prevotella, and
      Escherichia-Shigella. In addition, the microbiota of high SES children was less
      diverse and strongly associated with body mass index (BMI). In low SES children, 
      helminth infection was prevalent and positively associated with Olsenella,
      Enterohabdus, Lactobacillus, and Mogibacterium abundance, while negatively
      associated with relative abundance of Prevotella. Protozoa infection was also
      prevalent, and positively associated with Rikenellaceae, while it was negatively 
      associated with the relative abundance of Romboutsia and Prevotella. In
      conclusion, Indonesian schoolchildren living in urban Makassar share a core
      microbiota, but their microbiota varies in diversity and relative abundance of
      specific bacterial taxa depending on socioeconomic status, nutritional status,
      and intestinal parasites infection.

      species. In bivalves, the microbiota composition has been mainly investigated in 
      adults, whereas little information is available during development. In this work,
      the microbiota composition of the first larval stages of Mytilus
      galloprovincialis was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene-based profiling, at 24 and 48
      hours post fertilization in comparison with those of eggs and sperm. The main
      genera detected in both larvae (Vibrio, Pseudoalteromonas, Psychrobium,
      Colwellia) derived from eggs. However, a clear shift in microbiota was observed
      in developing larvae compared to eggs, both in terms of core microbiome and
      relative abundance of different genera. The results provide a first insight into 
      the composition of the microbial communities associated with gametes and early
      larvae of mussels. Moreover, the impact on larval microbiome of estrogenic
      chemicals that potentially affect Mytilus early development, 17betaestradiol-E2, 
      Bisphenol A-BPA and Bisphenol F-BPF (10 mug/L), was investigated. Exposure to
      estrogenic chemicals leads to changes in abundance of different genera, with
      distinct and common effects depending on the compound and larval stage. Both
      potential pathogens (Vibrio, Arcobacter, Tenacibaculum) and genera involved in
      xenobiotic biotransformation (Oleispira, Shewanella) were affected. The effects
      of estrogenic compounds on larval microbiome were not related to their
      developmental effects: however, the results address the importance of evaluating 
      the impact of emerging contaminants on the microbiota of marine invertebrates,
      including larval stages, that are most sensitive to environmental perturbations.

AB  - Antarctic cryoconite holes (CHs) are mostly perennially ice-lidded and
      sediment-filled depressions that constitute important features on glaciers and
      ice sheets. Once being hydrologically connected, these microbially dominated
      mini-ecosystems provide nutrients and biota for downstream environments. For
      example, the East Antarctic Anuchin Glacier gradually melts into the adjacent
      perennially ice-covered Lake Untersee, and CH biota from this glacier contribute 
      up to one third of the community composition in benthic microbial mats within the
      lake. However, biogeochemical features of these CHs and associated spatial
      patterns across the glacier are still unknown. Here we hypothesized about the CH 
      minerogenic composition between the different sources such as the medial moraine 
      and other zones. Further, we intended to investigate if the depth of the CH
      mirrors the CH community composition, organic matter (OM) content and would
      support productivity. In this study we show that both microbial communities and
      biogeochemical parameters in CHs were significantly different between the zones
      medial moraine and the glacier terminus. Variations in microbial community
      composition are the result of factors such as depth, diameter, organic matter,
      total carbon, particle size, and mineral diversity. More than 90% of all
      ribosomal sequence variants (RSV) reads were classified as Proteobacteria,
      Cyanobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria. Archaea were
      detected in 85% of all samples and exclusively belonged to the classes
      Halobacteria, Methanomicrobia, and Thermoplasmata. The most abundant genus was
      Halorubrum (Halobacteria) and was identified in nine RSVs. The core microbiome
      for bacteria comprised 30 RSVs that were affiliated with Cyanobacteria,
      Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. The archaeal fraction of the
      core microbiome consisted of three RSVs belonging to unknown genera of
      Methanomicrobiales and Thermoplasmatales and the genus Rice_Cluster_I
      (Methanocellales). Further, mean bacterial carbon production in cryoconite was
      exceptionally low and similar rates have not been reported elsewhere. However,
      bacterial carbon production insignificantly trended toward higher rates in
      shallow CHs and did not seem to be supported by accumulation of OM and nutrients,
      respectively, in deeper holes. OM fractions were significantly different between 
      shallower CHs along the medial moraine and deeper CHs at the glacier terminus.
      Overall, our findings suggest that wind-blown material originating south and
      southeast of the Anuchin Glacier and deposits from a nunatak are assumed to be
      local inoculation sources. High sequence similarities between samples from the
      Untersee Oasis and other Antarctic sites further indicate long-range atmospheric 
      transport mechanisms that complement local inoculation sources.

      Relationship with Metabolic Health.
PG  - 10085
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-67078-3 [doi]
AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) has become a worldwide health issue. Recent studies
      reveal that the human gut microbiota exerts a significant role in the
      pathogenesis of this disease. While drug treatments may greatly improve metabolic
      symptoms, little is known about the gut microbiota composition of these treated
      MetS patients. This study aimed to characterize the gut microbiota composition of
      treated-MetS patients and analyse the possibility of using gut microbiota as an
      indicator of metabolic conditions. 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing approach was
      used to profile gut microbiota of 111 treated MetS patients from The Cohort of
      patients at a high Risk of Cardiovascular Events (CORE)-Thailand registry. Our
      results show that the gut microbiota profiles of MetS patients are diverse across
      individuals, but can be classified based on their similarity into three groups or
      enterotypes. We also showed several associations between species abundance and
      metabolic parameters that are enterotype specific. These findings suggest that
      information on the gut microbiota can be useful for assessing treatment options
      for MetS patients. In addition, any correlations between species abundance and
      human properties are likely specific to each microbial community.

TI  - A Comparative Analysis of Ash Leaf-Colonizing Bacterial Communities Identifies
      Putative Antagonists of Hymenoscyphus fraxineus.
PG  - 966
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00966 [doi]
AB  - In the last few years, the alarming spread of Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, the causal
      agent of ash dieback, has resulted in a substantial threat to native ash stands
      in central and northern Europe. Since leaves and leaf petioles are the primary
      infection sites, phyllosphere microorganisms are presumed to interact with the
      pathogen and are discussed as a source of biocontrol agents. We studied compound 
      leaves from susceptible and visible infection-free trees in four ash stands with 
      a high likelihood of infection to assess a possible variation in the bacterial
      microbiota, depending on the health status of the trees. The bacterial community 
      was analyzed by culture-independent 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and through
      the isolation and taxonomic classification of 2,589 isolates using
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
      (MALDI-TOF MS). The bacterial community structure did not show significant
      differences. However, a set of amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) and MALDI groups
      belonging to Luteimonas, Aureimonas, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, and Paenibacillus
      were distinctly increased in tolerant trees, which may be associated with the
      ability of the tree to resist the pathogen. The most obvious differences were
      observed for Luteimonas, a genus that is also exclusively present in the healthy 
      core microbiome. In a first in vitro screen of antagonists, approximately 11% of 
      total isolates suppressed the growth of H. fraxineus, but a statistical test with
      two different H. fraxineus strains confirmed only the antagonistic activity of 8%
      of these isolates. The antagonistic isolates were assigned to Bacillus
      velezensis, Pantoea vagans, and Pseudomonas caspiana. Overall, our study provides
      a set of isolates or phylogenetic groups that might be involved in the process
      that prevents the penetration and spread of H. fraxineus. In the next step, in
      planta experiments are required with a longer period of exposure to H. fraxineus 
      to evaluate effective isolates or consortia of isolates acting through direct
      antagonism or competition or indirectly by inducing resistance.

TI  - Comparison of lung microbiota between antineutrophil cytoplasmic
      antibody-associated vasculitis and sarcoidosis.
PG  - 9466
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-66178-4 [doi]
AB  - Microbial involvement in the pathogenesis have been suggested in both
      antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and sarcoidosis, 
      both of which have lung involvement. However, exhaustive research to assess the
      bacteria in the lung in AAV and in sarcoidosis have not been performed. We sought
      to elucidate the distinct dysbiotic lung microbiota between AAV and sarcoidosis. 
      We used 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing to obtain the bacterial
      community composition of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) in patients with AAV
      (n = 16) compared to patients with sarcoidosis (n = 21). The patients had not
      undergone therapy with immunosuppressive medication when their BALF was acquired.
      No difference was observed in alpha-diversity between patients with AAV and
      patients with sarcoidosis when using all the detected taxa. We defined the taxa
      of the oral cavity by using the data of oral microbiota of healthy individuals
      from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). The analysis using only oral taxa made
      the difference in alpha-diversity between AAV and sarcoidosis clearer compared
      with those using all the detected taxa. Besides, the analysis using detected taxa
      except for oral taxa also made the difference in alpha-diversity between AAV and 
      sarcoidosis clearer compared with those using all the detected taxa. A linear
      negative relationship between the alpha-diversity and Birmingham vasculitis
      activity score (BVAS) was detected in the AAV group. The observed p-value for the
      effect of the disease groups on the ss-diversity was small while the effect of
      other factors including sex and smoking status did not have small p-values. By
      excluding oral taxa from all the detected taxa, we found a cluster mainly
      consisted of sarcoidosis patients which was characterized with microbial
      community monopolized by Erythrobacteraceae family. Our results suggested the
      importance of considering the influence of oral microbiota in evaluating lung
      microbiota.

AB  - An anaerobic hydrolysis denitrification (AnHD) process was developed to pretreat 
      municipal wastewater for integrating partial nitration/anammox process. The
      results indicated that the carbon to nitrogen (C/N) ratio of municipal wastewater
      changed from 4.4 +/- 0.3 to 2.2 +/- 0.2 after pretreatment by AnHD process, which
      was favorable to the partial nitration/anammox process. The influent C/N ratio
      had influence on the formation of anaerobic granules. Two intrinsic factors,
      cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) concentration and core bacterial community,
      were mainly responsible for the anaerobic granular formation. The higher c-di-GMP
      content increased the extracellular polymeric substances and decreased the
      motility of the bacteria, which was beneficial for the formation of anaerobic
      granules. The microbial community analysis showed that the lactic acid bacteria
      (Lactococcus) was the core bacteria during anaerobic hydrolysis process, while
      the denitrifying bacteria (Denitratisoma and unclassified Comamonadaceae) were
      the core bacterial community during AnHD process, which were responsible for
      nitrogen removal and anaerobic granular formation.

TI  - Assessing similarities and disparities in the skin microbiota between wild and
      laboratory populations of house mice.
PG  - 2367-2380
LID - 10.1038/s41396-020-0690-7 [doi]
AB  - The house mouse is a key model organism in skin research including
      host-microbiota interactions, yet little is known about the skin microbiota of
      free-living mice. It is similarly unclear how closely laboratory mice, which
      typically live under exceptionally hygienic conditions, resemble the ancestral
      state of microbial variation in the wild. In this study, we sampled an area
      spanning 270 km(2) in south-west France and collected 203 wild Mus musculus
      domesticus. We profiled the ear skin microbiota on standing and active
      communities (DNA-based and RNA-based 16 rRNA gene sequencing, respectively), and 
      compared multiple community aspects between wild-caught and laboratory-reared
      mice kept in distinct facilities. Compared to lab mice, we reveal the skin
      microbiota of wild mice on the one hand to be unique in their composition within 
      the Staphylococcus genus, with a majority of sequences most closely matching
      known novobiocin-resistant species, and display evidence of a rare biosphere. On 
      the other hand, despite drastic disparities between natural and laboratory
      environments, we find that shared taxa nonetheless make up the majority of the
      core skin microbiota of both wild- and laboratory skin communities, suggesting
      that mammalian skin is a highly specialized habitat capable of strong selection
      from available species pools. Finally, the influence of environmental factors
      suggests RNA-based profiling as a preferred method to reduce environmental noise.

TI  - Oral Microbiome of Children Living in an Isolated Area in Myanmar.
LID - E4033 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17114033 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have shown that the oral microbiome is related to systemic
      health, and a co-relation with several specific diseases has been suggested. The 
      oral microbiome depends on environmental- and community-level factors. In this
      observational study, the oral microbiomes of children of isolated mountain people
      were analyzed with respect to the core oral microbiome and etiology of dental
      caries. We collected samples of supragingival plaque from children (age 9-13)
      living in the Chin state of Myanmar. After DNA extraction and purification,
      next-generation sequencing of the V3-V4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA was
      conducted. From thirteen subjects, 263,458 valid reads and 640 operational
      taxonomic units were generated at a 97% identity cut-off value. At the phylum
      level, Proteobacteria was the most abundant, followed by Firmicutes and
      Bacteroides. Forty-four bacteria were detected in total from all the subjects.
      For children without dental caries, Proteobacteria was abundant. In contrast, in 
      children with dental caries, Firmicutes and Bacteroides were abundant. The oral
      microbiome of children living in an isolated area may be affected by
      environmental- and community-level factors. Additionally, the composition of the 
      oral microbiome may affect the risk of dental caries.

TI  - The Core Gut Microbiome of Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) Larvae Raised on
      Low-Bioburden Diets.
PG  - 993
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00993 [doi]
AB  - An organism's gut microbiome handles most of the metabolic processes associated
      with food intake and digestion but can also strongly affect health and behavior. 
      A stable microbial core community in the gut provides general metabolic
      competences for substrate degradation and is robust against extrinsic
      disturbances like changing diets or pathogens. Black Soldier Fly larvae (BSFL;
      Hermetia illucens) are well known for their ability to efficiently degrade a wide
      spectrum of organic materials. The ingested substrates build up the high fat and 
      protein content in their bodies that make the larvae interesting for the animal
      feedstuff industry. In this study, we subjected BSFL to three distinct types of
      diets carrying a low bioburden and assessed the diets' impact on larval
      development and on the composition of the bacterial and archaeal gut community.
      No significant impact on the gut microbiome across treatments pointed us to the
      presence of a predominant core community backed by a diverse spectrum of
      low-abundance taxa. Actinomyces spp., Dysgonomonas spp., and Enterococcus spp. as
      main members of this community provide various functional and metabolic skills
      that could be crucial for the thriving of BSFL in various environments. This
      indicates that the type of diet could play a lesser role in guts of BSFL than
      previously assumed and that instead a stable autochthonous collection of bacteria
      provides the tools for degrading of a broad range of substrates. Characterizing
      the interplay between the core gut microbiome and BSFL helps to understand the
      involved degradation processes and could contribute to further improving
      large-scale BSFL rearing.

TI  - Integration of metagenomics-metabolomics reveals specific signatures and
      functions of airway microbiota in mite-sensitized childhood asthma.
LID - 10.1111/all.14438 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Childhood asthma is a multifactorial inflammatory condition of the
      airways, associated with specific changes in respiratory microbiome and
      circulating metabolome. METHODS: To explore the functional capacity of asthmatic 
      microbiome and its intricate connection with the host, we performed shotgun
      sequencing of airway microbiome and untargeted metabolomics profiling of serum
      samples in a cohort of children with mite-sensitized asthma and non-asthmatic
      controls. RESULTS: We observed higher gene counts and sample-to-sample
      dissimilarities in asthmatic microbiomes, indicating a more heterogeneous
      community structure and functionality among the cases than in controls. Moreover,
      we identified airway microbial species linked to changes in circulating
      metabolites and IgE responses of the host, including a positive correlation
      between Prevotella sp oral taxon 306 and dimethylglycine that were both decreased
      in patients. Several control-enriched species (Eubacterium sulci, Prevotella
      pallens, and Prevotella sp oral taxon 306) were inversely correlated with total
      and allergen-specific IgE levels. Genes related to microbial carbohydrate, amino 
      acid, and lipid metabolism were differentially enriched, suggesting that changes 
      in microbial metabolism may contribute to respiratory health in asthmatics.
      Pathway modules relevant to allergic responses were differentially abundant in
      asthmatic microbiome, such as enrichments for biofilm formation by Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, membrane trafficking, histidine metabolism, and glycosaminoglycan
      degradation, and depletions for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degradation.
      Further, we identified metagenomic and metabolomic markers (eg, Eubacterium
      sulci) to discriminate cases from the non-asthmatic controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      dual-omics data reveal the connections between respiratory microbes and
      circulating metabolites perturbed in mite-sensitized pediatric asthma, which may 
      be of etiological and diagnostic implications.

TI  - Crosstalk Between Culturomics and Microbial Profiling of Egyptian Mongoose
      (Herpestes ichneumon) Gut Microbiome.
LID - E808 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8060808 [doi]
AB  - Recently, we unveiled taxonomical and functional differences in Egyptian mongoose
      (Herpestes ichneumon) gut microbiota across sex and age classes by microbial
      profiling. In this study, we generate, through culturomics, extended baseline
      information on the culturable bacterial and fungal microbiome of the species
      using the same specimens as models. Firstly, this strategy enabled us to explore 
      cultivable microbial community differences across sexes and to ascertain the
      influence exerted by biological and environmental contexts of each host in its
      microbiota signature. Secondly, it permitted us to compare the culturomics and
      microbial profiling approaches and their ability to provide information on
      mongoose gut microbiota. In agreement with microbial profiling, culturomics
      showed that the core gut cultivable microbiota of the mongoose is dominated by
      Firmicutes and, as previously found, is able to distinguish sex- and age
      class-specific genera. Additional information could be obtained by culturomics,
      with six new genera unveiled. Richness indices and the Shannon index were
      concordant between culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches,
      highlighting significantly higher values when using microbial profiling. However,
      the Simpson index underlined higher values for the culturomics-generated data.
      These contrasting results were due to a differential influence of dominant and
      rare taxa on those indices. Beta diversity analyses of culturable microbiota
      showed similarities between adults and juveniles, but not in the data series
      originated from microbial profiling. Additionally, whereas the microbial
      profiling indicated that there were several bioenvironmental features related to 
      the bacterial gut microbiota of the Egyptian mongoose, a clear association
      between microbiota and bioenvironmental features could not be established through
      culturomics. The discrepancies found between the data generated by the two
      methodologies and the underlying inferences, both in terms of beta-diversity and 
      role of bioenvironmental features, confirm that culture-independent,
      sequence-based methods have a higher ability to assess, at a fine scale, the
      influence of abiotic and biotic factors on the microbial community composition of
      mongoose' gut. However, when used in a complementary perspective, this knowledge 
      can be expanded by culturomics.

TI  - Trichloroethylene inhibits nitrogen transformation and microbial community
      structure in Mollisol.
PG  - 801-813
LID - 10.1007/s10646-020-02230-3 [doi]
AB  - Trichloroethylene (TCE) is the most ubiquitous halogenated organic pollutant in
      the environment, it is one of the 129 priority control pollutants. In order to
      clarify the influence of TCE on microorganisms and nitrogen transformation in
      Mollisol is the core purpose of this study. Results showed that 10 mg kg(-1) TCE 
      is the concentration limit of ammonification in Mollisol. When the concentration 
      of TCE reached 10 mg kg(-1) and the effect lasted for over 7 days, the process of
      ammonia oxidation to nitric acid in Mollisol will be affected. TCE affected the
      process of nitrate (NO3(-)) transformation into nitrite (NO2(-)) by affecting the
      activity of nitrate reductase, thereby affected the denitrification process in
      soil. When the concentration of TCE is more than 10 mg kg(-1) it reduced the
      ability of soil microorganisms to obtain nitrogen, thereby affecting soil
      nitrogen transformation. RDA (Redundancy analysis) showed that the activity of
      nitrate reductase and the number of nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria
      in soil was negatively correlated with the incubation of TCE. In addition, soil
      nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, peroxidase activity, ammonifying bacteria, 
      nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria were negatively correlated with TCE
      concentration. Beyond that PICRUSt (Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by 
      Reconstruction of Unobserved States) of functional gene structure depend on KEGG 
      (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) showed that 20 mg kg(-1) TCE
      significantly inhibited the metabolism of energy and other substances in
      Mollisol. Based on the above, it is found that TCE significantly affected
      nitrification and denitrification in Mollisol, thus the nitrogen transformation
      in Mollisol was affected by TCE contamination.

TI  - Extrication of the Microbial Interactions of Activated Sludge Used in the Textile
      Effluent Treatment of Anaerobic Reactor Through Metagenomic Profiling.
PG  - 2496-2509
LID - 10.1007/s00284-020-02020-4 [doi]
AB  - Industrial effluents are potential threats to water bodies owing to the chemicals
      they contain to create pollution. Activated sludge effluents represent an
      ecosystem of multifaceted and interactive microbial consortia that flourish with 
      different genetic as well as metabolic potential. This study is applied to a
      nanopore sequencing to understand the microbial organisms involved in degradation
      pathways, and their interaction among them. The taxonomic profile determined the 
      occurrence of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Terrabacteria, bacteria, and
      Firmicutes with the dominance of Burkholderiales. Burkholderia pseudomallei was
      found to be 13.79% of the classified reads. The Gene ontology evaluation revealed
      that mobile elements and tRNA genes were the predominant genetic composition of
      the community with 16% of the total genes. The functional annotation of genes
      ensured the presence of genes encoding various types of RNA, homo and
      heteromultimeric proteins and pseudogenes as well. Pathways that involved in
      effluent treatment such as amines, aromatic, organic, and aromatic compound
      degradation were also illustrated. Amino acyl tRNA charging, signal transduction,
      and hormone degradation were the pathways that are identified to be common in all
      the organisms of the activated sludge. The study elaborated on the xenobiotic
      degradation that is exclusive of the predominant Burkholderiales and the
      interaction of them in the community as a whole. The present study revealed the
      genes, proteins, and the pathways of the activated sludge microbiome which will
      enhance the perceptions of the core mechanisms of effluent degradation.

TI  - Adaptive matching between phyllosphere bacteria and their tree hosts in a
      neotropical forest.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/s40168-020-00844-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The phyllosphere is an important microbial habitat, but our
      understanding of how plant hosts drive the composition of their associated leaf
      microbial communities and whether taxonomic associations between plants and
      phyllosphere microbes represent adaptive matching remains limited. In this study,
      we quantify bacterial functional diversity in the phyllosphere of 17 tree species
      in a diverse neotropical forest using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. We ask how 
      hosts drive the functional composition of phyllosphere communities and their
      turnover across tree species, using host functional traits and phylogeny.
      RESULTS: Neotropical tree phyllosphere communities are dominated by functions
      related to the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and energy acquisition, 
      along with environmental signalling pathways involved in membrane transport.
      While most functional variation was observed within communities, there is
      non-random assembly of microbial functions across host species possessing
      different leaf traits. Metabolic functions related to biosynthesis and
      degradation of secondary compounds, along with signal transduction and cell-cell 
      adhesion, were particularly important in driving the match between microbial
      functions and host traits. These microbial functions were also evolutionarily
      conserved across the host phylogeny. CONCLUSIONS: Functional profiling based on
      metagenomic shotgun sequencing offers evidence for the presence of a core
      functional microbiota across phyllosphere communities of neotropical trees. While
      functional turnover across phyllosphere communities is relatively small, the
      association between microbial functions and leaf trait gradients among host
      species supports a significant role for plant hosts as selective filters on
      phyllosphere community assembly. This interpretation is supported by the presence
      of phylogenetic signal for the microbial traits driving inter-community variation
      across the host phylogeny. Taken together, our results suggest that there is
      adaptive matching between phyllosphere microbes and their plant hosts. Video

TI  - Effects on the Ileal Microbiota of Phosphorus and Calcium Utilization, Bird
      Performance, and Gender in Japanese Quail.
LID - E885 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani10050885 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we aimed to investigate the ileum digesta of a large cohort of
      Japanese quail fed the same diet, with similar environmental conditions. We also 
      address how P utilization (PU), Ca utilization (CaU), and bird performance (feed 
      intake (FI), feed conversion (FC), and body weight gain (BWG)) modify intestinal 
      microbiota of male and female quail. Despite the great number of samples analyzed
      (760), a core microbiome was composed of five bacteria. The Unc. Lactobacillus,
      Unc. Clostridaceae 1, Clostridium sensu stricto, Escherichia coli, and
      Streptococcus alactolyticus were detected in all samples and contributed to more 
      than 70% of the total community. Depending on the bird predisposition for PU,
      CaU, FI, BWG, and FC, those species were present in higher or lower abundances.
      There was a significant gender effect on the ileal microbial community. While
      females had higher abundances of Lactobacillus, males were more colonized by
      Streptococcus alactolyticus. The entire cohort was highly colonized by
      Escherichia coli (8%-15%), an enteropathogenic bacteria. It remains unclear, if
      microbiota composition followed the mechanisms that caused different PU, CaU, FI,
      FC, and BWG or if the change in microbiota composition and function caused the
      differences in PU, CaU, and performance traits.

TI  - Long-Term Nutrient Enrichment of an Oligotroph-Dominated Wetland Increases
      Bacterial Diversity in Bulk Soils and Plant Rhizospheres.
LID - e00035-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSphere.00035-20 [doi]
AB  - In nutrient-limited conditions, plants rely on rhizosphere microbial members to
      facilitate nutrient acquisition, and in return, plants provide carbon resources
      to these root-associated microorganisms. However, atmospheric nutrient deposition
      can affect plant-microbe relationships by changing soil bacterial composition and
      by reducing cooperation between microbial taxa and plants. To examine how
      long-term nutrient addition shapes rhizosphere community composition, we compared
      traits associated with bacterial (fast-growing copiotrophs, slow-growing
      oligotrophs) and plant (C3 forb, C4 grass) communities residing in a
      nutrient-poor wetland ecosystem. Results revealed that oligotrophic taxa
      dominated soil bacterial communities and that fertilization increased the
      presence of oligotrophs in bulk and rhizosphere communities. Additionally,
      bacterial species diversity was greatest in fertilized soils, particularly in
      bulk soils. Nutrient enrichment (fertilized versus unfertilized) and plant
      association (bulk versus rhizosphere) determined bacterial community composition;
      bacterial community structure associated with plant functional group (grass
      versus forb) was similar within treatments but differed between fertilization
      treatments. The core forb microbiome consisted of 602 unique taxa, and the core
      grass microbiome consisted of 372 unique taxa. Forb rhizospheres were enriched in
      potentially disease-suppressive bacterial taxa, and grass rhizospheres were
      enriched in bacterial taxa associated with complex carbon decomposition. Results 
      from this study demonstrate that fertilization serves as a strong environmental
      filter on the soil microbiome, which leads to distinct rhizosphere communities
      and can shift plant effects on the rhizosphere microbiome. These taxonomic shifts
      within plant rhizospheres could have implications for plant health and ecosystem 
      functions associated with carbon and nitrogen cycling.IMPORTANCE Over the last
      century, humans have substantially altered nitrogen and phosphorus cycling. Use
      of synthetic fertilizer and burning of fossil fuels and biomass have increased
      nitrogen and phosphorus deposition, which results in unintended fertilization of 
      historically low-nutrient ecosystems. With increased nutrient availability, plant
      biodiversity is expected to decline, and the abundance of copiotrophic taxa is
      anticipated to increase in bacterial communities. Here, we address how bacterial 
      communities associated with different plant functional types (forb, grass) shift 
      due to long-term nutrient enrichment. Unlike other studies, results revealed an
      increase in bacterial diversity, particularly of oligotrophic bacteria in
      fertilized plots. We observed that nutrient addition strongly determines forb and
      grass rhizosphere composition, which could indicate different metabolic
      preferences in the bacterial communities. This study highlights how long-term
      fertilization of oligotroph-dominated wetlands could alter diversity and
      metabolism of rhizosphere bacterial communities in unexpected ways.

TI  - Spatial mapping of polymicrobial communities reveals a precise biogeography
      associated with human dental caries.
PG  - 12375-12386
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1919099117 [doi]
AB  - Tooth decay (dental caries) is a widespread human disease caused by microbial
      biofilms. Streptococcus mutans, a biofilm-former, has been consistently
      associated with severe childhood caries; however, how this bacterium is spatially
      organized with other microorganisms in the oral cavity to promote disease remains
      unknown. Using intact biofilms formed on teeth of toddlers affected by caries, we
      discovered a unique 3D rotund-shaped architecture composed of multiple species
      precisely arranged in a corona-like structure with an inner core of S. mutans
      encompassed by outer layers of other bacteria. This architecture creates
      localized regions of acidic pH and acute enamel demineralization (caries) in a
      mixed-species biofilm model on human teeth, suggesting this highly ordered
      community as the causative agent. Notably, the construction of this architecture 
      was found to be an active process initiated by production of an extracellular
      scaffold by S. mutans that assembles the corona cell arrangement, encapsulating
      the pathogen core. In addition, this spatial patterning creates a protective
      barrier against antimicrobials while increasing bacterial acid fitness associated
      with the disease-causing state. Our data reveal a precise biogeography in a
      polymicrobial community associated with human caries that can modulate the
      pathogen positioning and virulence potential in situ, indicating that
      micron-scale spatial structure of the microbiome may mediate the function and
      outcome of host-pathogen interactions.

AB  - Understanding microbial communities' roles in human health and disease requires
      methods that accurately characterize the microbial composition and their activity
      and effects within human biological samples. We present sMETASeq (small RNA
      Metagenomics by Sequencing), a novel method that uses sequencing of small RNAs to
      jointly measure host small RNA expression and create metagenomic profiles and
      detect small bacterial RNAs. We evaluated the performance of sMETASeq on a mock
      bacterial community and demonstrated its use on different human samples,
      including colon cancer, oral leukoplakia, cervix cancer, and a panel of human
      biofluids. In all datasets, the detected microbes reflected the biology of the
      different sample types.

LID - 10.1111/mec.15470 [doi]
AB  - Communities are shaped by scale dependent processes. To study the diversity and
      variation of microbial communities across scales, the invasive and widespread
      seaweed Agarophyton vermiculophyllum presents a unique opportunity. We
      characterized pro- and eukaryotic communities associated with this holobiont
      across its known distribution range, which stretches over the northern
      hemisphere. Our data reveal that community composition and diversity in the
      holobiont vary at local but also larger geographic scales. While processes acting
      at the local scale (i.e., within population) are the main structuring drivers of 
      associated microbial communities, changes in community composition also depend on
      processes acting at larger geographic scales. Interestingly, the largest analysed
      scale (i.e., native and non-native ranges) explained variation in the prevalence 
      of predicted functional groups, which could suggest a functional shift in
      microbiota occurred over the course of the invasion process. While high
      variability in microbiota at the local scale supports A. vermiculophyllum to be a
      generalist host, we also identified a number of core taxa. These geographically
      independent holobiont members imply that cointroduction of specific microbiota
      may have additionally promoted the invasion process.

AB  - Tree roots attract their associated microbial partners from the local soil
      community. Accordingly, tree root-associated microbial communities are shaped by 
      both the host tree and local environmental variables. To rationally compare the
      magnitude of environmental conditions and host tree impact, the "PhytOakmeter"
      project planted clonal oak saplings (Quercus robur L., clone DF159) as
      phytometers into different field sites that are within a close geographic space
      across the Central German lowland region. The PhytOakmeters were produced via
      micro-propagation to maintain their genetic identity. The current study analyzed 
      the microbial communities in the PhytOakmeter root zone vs. the tree root-free
      zone of soil two years after out-planting the trees. Soil DNA was extracted, 16S 
      and ITS2 genes were respectively amplified for bacteria and fungi, and sequenced 
      using Illumina MiSeq technology. The obtained microbial communities were analyzed
      in relation to soil chemistry and weather data as environmental conditions, and
      the host tree growth. Although microbial diversity in soils of the tree root zone
      was similar among the field sites, the community structure was site-specific.
      Likewise, within respective sites, the microbial diversity between PhytOakmeter
      root and root-free zones was comparable. The number of microbial species
      exclusive to either zone, however, was higher in the host tree root zone than in 
      the tree root-free zone. PhytOakmeter "core" and "site-specific" microbiomes were
      identified and attributed to the host tree selection effect and/or to the ambient
      conditions of the sites, respectively. The identified PhytOakmeter root
      zone-associated microbiome predominantly included ectomycorrhizal fungi, yeasts
      and saprotrophs. Soil pH, soil organic matter, and soil temperature were
      significantly correlated with the microbial diversity and/or community structure.
      Although the host tree contributed to shape the soil microbial communities, its
      effect was surpassed by the impact of environmental factors. The current study
      helps to understand site-specific microbe recruitment processes by young host
      trees.

TI  - Structure and membership of gut microbial communities in multiple fish cryptic
      species under potential migratory effects.
PG  - 7547
LID - 10.1038/s41598-020-64570-8 [doi]
AB  - The animal gut microbiota evolves quickly towards a complex community and plays
      crucial roles in its host's health and development. Factors such as host genetics
      and environmental changes are regarded as important for controlling the dynamics 
      of animal gut microbiota. Migratory animals are an important group for studying
      how these factors influence gut microbiota because they experience strong
      environmental perturbations during migration. The commercially important grey
      mullet, Mugil cephalus, is a cosmopolitan species complex that display
      reproductive migration behaviour. There are three cryptic species of M. cephalus 
      fish distributed across the Northwest Pacific, and their spawning sites overlap
      in the Taiwan Strait. This extraordinary natural occurrence makes the grey mullet
      an ideal model organism for exploring the nature of wild animal-gut microbiota
      relationships and interactions. This study investigates the diversity and
      structure of the gut microbial community in three cryptic M. cephalus species
      using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Gut microbial compositions from adult and
      juvenile fish samples were analysed. Our results indicate that gut microbial
      communities within the grey mullet share a core microbiome dominated by
      Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. However, the structures of gut
      microbial communities were more distinct between adult mullet groups than they
      were between juvenile ones. Intriguingly, we found that adult fish that migrate
      to different geographical tracts harbour gut microbiota similar to historical
      records of seawater microflora, along their respective migration routes. This
      observation provides new insights into the interaction between aquatic animal gut
      microbial communities and the environments along their hosts' migratory routes,
      and thus warrants future study.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of probiotic-based formulations on cecal microbiota
      modulation in broilers.
PG  - e0225871
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0225871 [doi]
AB  - The potential of probiotics to manipulate the intestinal microbial ecosystem
      toward commensal bacteria growth offers great opportunity for enhancing health
      and performance in poultry. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of five
      probiotic-based formulations in modulating cecal microbiota in broilers at 21 and
      42 days of age. Probiotics investigated included a synbiotic (SYNBIO), a yeast
      (YEAST), and three single-strain formulations of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens
      (SINGLE1), B. subtilis (SINGLE2) and B. licheniformis (SINGLE3). Alpha-diversity 
      analyses showed that cecal microbiota of SINGLE1, SINGLE2, and YEAST had low
      diversity compared to the control diet with no feed additive (CON) at 21d. At the
      same age, weighted Unifrac distance measure showed significant differences
      between samples from SYNBIO and CON (P = 0.02). However, by analyzing principal
      coordinates analysis (PCoA) with unweighted Unifrac, there was no evidence of
      clustering between CON and probiotic treatments. By 42d, there were no
      differences in alpha or beta-diversity in the microbiota of probiotic treatments 
      compared to CON. Similarly, taxonomic microbial profiling did not show major
      changes in cecal microbial taxa. In conclusion, not all probiotic-based
      formulations tested had a core benefit on the modulation of microbiota. However, 
      based on the quantitative beta diversity results, SYNBIO greatly influenced the
      cecal microbial community structure attributable to transient variations in
      relative taxon abundance.

AB  - This study evaluates the microbial community development in the suspended sludge 
      within a pilot-scale gas sparged Anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR) under
      ambient conditions, as well as understand the influence of microbial signatures
      in the influent municipal wastewater on the bioreactor using amplicon sequence
      analysis. The predominant bacterial phyla comprised of Bacteroidetes,
      Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi demonstrated resiliency with ambient 
      temperature operation over a period of 472 days. Acetoclastic Methanosaeta were
      predominant during most of the AnMBR operation. Beta diversity analysis indicated
      that the microbial communities present in the influent wastewater did not affect 
      the AnMBR core microbiome. Syntrophic microbial interactions were evidenced by
      the presence of the members from Synergistales, Anaerolineales, Clostridiales,
      and Syntrophobacterales. The proliferation of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB)
      along with sulfate reduction underscored the competition of SRB in the AnMBR.
      Operational and environmental variables did not greatly alter the core bacterial 
      population based on canonical correspondence analysis.

      various parts of the human body. Here, we report the draft genome sequences of
      Bifidobacterium animalis isolated from two healthy Japanese volunteers, one of
      which was sampled twice before and after a 10-year interval. A core genome
      phylogeny analysis indicated that the strains isolated from the same volunteer
      were closely related. This paper is the first report of multiple draft genome
      sequences of B. animalis independently isolated from the same individual and
      provides insight into the probiotic potential of a member of this species.

TI  - Effects of hydrolyzed fish protein and autolyzed yeast as substitutes of fishmeal
      in the gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata) diet, on fish intestinal microbiome.
PG  - 118
LID - 10.1186/s12917-020-02335-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effects of partial substitution of dietary
      fishmeal (FM) with either fish protein hydrolysate (FPH) or autolysed dried yeast
      (HiCell(R), Biorigin, Brazil) on intestinal microbiota of gilthead sea bream
      (Sparus aurata). A total number of 720 fish of 122.18 +/- 6.22 g were fed for 92 
      days with three different diets in triplicate (3 tanks/diet). A diet based on
      FM/vegetable meal was used as control. The other two diets were formulated by
      replacing FM with 5% of either FPH or HiCell(R). To analyze the gut microbiota
      associated to autochthonous and allochthonous microbial communities, the Illumina
      MiSeq platform for sequencing of 16S rRNA gene and QIIME pipeline were used.
      RESULTS: A total number of 102 OTUs (operational taxonomic units) at 97% identity
      were identified in fish gut samples collected at the end of feeding trial.
      Fourteen OTUs constituted the core gut microbiota, i.e. those OTUs found in at
      least nine out of fifteen samples per group and shared regardless of the diet.
      Eight OTUs were assigned to Firmicutes represented by Lactobacillus,
      Staphylococcus, and Bacillus genera, and six to Proteobacteria phylum. Dietary
      dried yeast autolysate modulated the intestinal microbiota by promoting the
      growth of some beneficial bacteria. At order level, fish fed yeast showed an
      enrichment in Bacillales and Clostridiales as compared to the control group,
      whereas fish fed FPH showed a significantly lower amount of bacteria belonging to
      Alteromonadales and Enterobacteriales than the other two feeding groups. Although
      we did not observe any effect of 5% FM replacement with alternative nitrogen
      sources at phylum level, at lower taxonomical levels, the composition of gut
      microbiota, in terms of relative abundance of specific taxa, was significantly
      influenced by the dietary treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The metabarcoding analysis
      revealed a clearly intestinal microbiota modulation in response to dietary
      autolyzed yeast. The abundance of some beneficial bacteria, i.e. indigestible
      carbohydrate degrading- and SCFA producing bacteria, was positively affected.
      Autolysed dried yeast obtained by the fermentation of a strain of Saccharomyces

AB  - Denitrification, an important process in microbial mediated nitrogen cycle, plays
      important roles in nitrogen loss in estuarine sediments. However, the function of
      denitrifiers in the estuarine subsurface sediments remained poorly understood. In
      this study, we analyzed the potential activity, abundance and community structure
      of nirS-type denitrifiers using 15N-labeled incubation quantitative-PCR and high 
      throughput sequencing techniques in sediment cores from Pearl River Estuary
      (PRE). Results showed that subsurface sediments had nearly same level
      denitrification potential activity compare to surface sediments, although the
      abundance of nirS gene decreased sharply from surface to bottom in sediment
      cores. Meanwhile, nirS gene abundance exhibit significant temporal variations,
      which is consistent with denitrification potential activity. Moreover, the
      community structure and diversity of nirS-type denitrifiers in sediment cores
      exhibited remarkable temporal shift pattern. For spatial variation, no
      significant difference was observed of denitrifiers community structure in each
      sediment core from the surface to the subsurface, while there were significant
      different diversity characteristic among different cores. Redundancy analysis
      (RDA) showed that multiple environmental factors including salinity, pH,
      oxidation-reduction potential, nutrient content and organic substances
      synergistically shaped the diversity and distribution of nirS-type denitrifers in
      PRE sediments. Our results showed that nirS-type denitrifers played important
      roles in the nitrogen removal in subsurface sediments of PRE.

AB  - Host-associated microbes facilitate diverse biotic and abiotic interactions
      between hosts and their environments. Experimental alterations of host-associated
      microbial communities frequently decrease host fitness, yet much less is known
      about if and how host-microbiome interactions are altered by natural
      perturbations, such as introduction events. Here, we begin to assess this
      question in Onthophagus dung beetles, a species-rich and geographically widely
      distributed genus whose members rely on vertically transmitted microbiota to
      support normal development. Specifically, we investigated to what extent
      microbiome community membership shifts during host introduction events and the
      relative significance of ancestral associations and novel environmental
      conditions in the structuring of microbial communities of introduced host
      species. Our results demonstrate that both evolutionary history and local
      environmental forces structure the microbial communities of these animals, but
      that their relative importance is shaped by the specific circumstances that
      characterize individual introduction events. Furthermore, we identify microbial
      taxa such as Dysgonomonas that may constitute members of the core Onthophagus
      microbiome regardless of host population or species, but also Wolbachia which
      associates with Onthophagus beetles in a species or even population-specific
      manner. We discuss the implications of our results for our understanding of the
      evolutionary ecology of symbiosis in dung beetles and beyond.

AB  - The environment affects the composition and function of soil microbiome, which
      indirectly influences the quality of plants. In this study, 16S amplicon
      sequencing was used to reveal the differences in soil microbial community
      composition of Cistanche deserticola in three ecotypes (saline-alkali land,
      grassland and sandy land). Through the correlation analysis of microbial
      community abundance, phenylethanoid glycoside contents and ecological factors,
      the regulatory relationship between microbial community and the quality variation
      of C. deserticola was expounded. The metabolic function profile of soil
      microbiome was predicted using Tax4Fun. Data showed that the soil microbial
      communities of the three ecotypes were significantly different (AMOVA, P <
      0.001), and the alpha diversity of grassland soil microbial community was the
      highest. Core microbiome analysis demonstrated that the soil microbial
      communities of C. deserticola were mostly have drought, salt tolerance, alkali
      resistance and stress resistance, such as Micrococcales and Bacillales. The
      biomarkers, namely, Oceanospirillales (saline-alkali land), Sphingomonadales
      (grassland) and Propionibacteriales (sandy land), which can distinguish three
      ecotype microbial communities, were excavated through LEfSe and random forest.
      Correlation analysis results demonstrated that 2'-acetylacteoside is positively
      correlated with Oceanospirillales in saline-alkali land soil. The metabolic
      function profiles displayed highly enriched metabolism (carbohydrate and amino
      acid metabolisms) and environmental information processing (membrane transport
      and signal transduction) pathways. Overall, the composition and function of soil 
      microbiomes were found to be important factors to the quality variation of C.
      deserticola in different ecotypes. This work provided new insight into the
      regulatory relationship amongst the environment, soil microbial community and
      plant quality variation.

TI  - A Bottom-Up Approach To Develop a Synthetic Microbial Community Model:
      Application for Efficient Reduced-Salt Broad Bean Paste Fermentation.
LID - e00306-20 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00306-20 [doi]
AB  - Humans have used high salinity for the production of bean-based fermented foods
      over thousands of years. Although high salinity can inhibit the growth of harmful
      microbes and select functional microbiota in an open environment, it also affects
      fermentation efficiency of bean-based fermented foods and has a negative impact
      on people's health. Therefore, it is imperative to develop novel defined starter 
      cultures for reduced-salt fermentation in a sterile environment. Here, we
      explored the microbial assembly and function in the fermentation of traditional
      Chinese broad bean paste with 12% salinity. The results revealed that the
      salinity and microbial interactions together drove the dynamic of community and
      pointed out that five dominant genera (Staphylococcus, Bacillus, Weissella,
      Aspergillus, and Zygosaccharomyces) may play different key roles in different
      fermentation stages. Then, core species were isolated from broad bean paste, and 
      their salinity tolerance, interactions, and metabolic characteristics were
      evaluated. The results provided an opportunity to validate in situ predictions
      through in vitro dissection of microbial assembly and function. Last, we
      reconstructed the synthetic microbial community with five strains (Aspergillus
      oryzae, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus gallinarum, Weissella confusa, and
      Zygosaccharomyces rouxii) under different salinities and realized efficient
      fermentation of broad bean paste for 6 weeks in a sterile environment with 6%
      salinity. In general, this work provided a bottom-up approach for the development
      of a simplified microbial community model with desired functions to improve the
      fermentation efficiency of bean-based fermented foods by deconstructing and
      reconstructing the microbial structure and function.IMPORTANCE Humans have
      mastered high-salinity fermentation techniques for bean-based fermented product
      preparation over thousands of years. High salinity was used to select the
      functional microbiota and conducted food fermentation production with unique
      flavor. Although a high-salinity environment is beneficial for suppressing
      harmful microbes in the open fermentation environment, the fermentation
      efficiency of functional microbes is partially inhibited. Therefore, application 
      of defined starter cultures for reduced-salt fermentation in a sterile
      environment is an alternative approach to improve the fermentation efficiency of 
      bean-based fermented foods and guide the transformation of traditional industry. 
      However, the assembly and function of self-organized microbiota in an open
      fermentation environment are still unclear. This study provides a comprehensive
      understanding of microbial function and the mechanism of community succession in 
      a high-salinity environment during the fermentation of broad bean paste so as to 
      reconstruct the microbial community and realize efficient fermentation of broad
      bean paste in a sterile environment.

      importance of aerobic metabolism in Svalbard permafrost.
LID - fiaa057 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiaa057 [doi]
AB  - Permafrost underlies a large portion of the land in the Northern Hemisphere. It
      is proposed to be an extreme habitat and home for cold-adaptive microbial
      communities. Upon thaw permafrost is predicted to exacerbate increasing global
      temperature trend, where awakening microbes decompose millennia old carbon
      stocks. Yet our knowledge on composition, functional potential and variance of
      permafrost microbiome remains limited. In this study, we conducted a deep
      comparative metagenomic analysis through a 2 m permafrost core from Svalbard,
      Norway to determine key permafrost microbiome in this climate sensitive island
      ecosystem. To do so, we developed comparative metagenomics methods on
      metagenomic-assembled genomes (MAG). We found that community composition in
      Svalbard soil horizons shifted markedly with depth: the dominant phylum switched 
      from Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria in top soils (active layer) to
      Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria in permafrost
      layers. Key metabolic potential propagated through permafrost depths revealed
      aerobic respiration and soil organic matter decomposition as key metabolic
      traits. We also found that Svalbard MAGs were enriched in genes involved in
      regulation of ammonium, sulfur and phosphate. Here, we provide a new perspective 
      on how permafrost microbiome is shaped to acquire resources in competitive and
      limited resource conditions of deep Svalbard soils.

TI  - The trisaccharide melezitose impacts honey bees and their intestinal microbiota.
PG  - e0230871
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0230871 [doi]
AB  - In general, honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) feed on honey produced from collected 
      nectar. In the absence of nectar, during certain times of the year or in
      monocultural landscapes, honey bees forage on honeydew. Honeydew is excreted by
      different herbivores of the order Hemiptera that consume phloem sap of plant
      species. In comparison to nectar, honeydew is composed of a higher variety of
      sugars and additional sugars with higher molecular weight, like the trisaccharide
      melezitose that can be a major constituent of honeydew. However,
      melezitose-containing honey is known to cause malnutrition in overwintering honey
      bees. Following the hypothesis that melezitose may be the cause for the so called
      'honeydew flow disease', three independent feeding experiments with caged bees
      were conducted in consecutive years. Bees fed with melezitose showed increased
      food uptake, higher gut weights and elevated mortality compared to bees fed a
      control diet. Moreover, severe disease symptoms, such as swollen abdomen, abdomen
      tipping and impaired movement were observed in melezitose-fed bees. 16S-amplicon 
      sequencing indicated that the melezitose diet changed the species composition of 
      the lactic acid bacteria community within the gut microbiota. Based on these
      results, we conclude that melezitose cannot be easily digested by the host and
      may accumulate in the hindgut. Within cages or during winter, when there is no
      opportunity for excretion, the accumulated melezitose can cause severe intestinal
      symptoms and death of the bees, probably as result of poor melezitose metabolism 
      capabilities in the intestinal microbiota. These findings confirm the causal
      relation between the trisaccharide melezitose and the honeydew flow disease and
      indicate a possible mechanism of pathogenesis.

TI  - Influence of plant genotype and soil on the wheat rhizosphere microbiome:
      evidences for a core microbiome across eight African and European soils.

LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiaa067 [doi]
AB  - Here, we assessed the relative influence of wheat genotype, agricultural
      practices (conventional vs organic) and soil type on the rhizosphere microbiome. 
      We characterized the prokaryotic (archaea and bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi and
      protists) communities in soils from four different countries (Cameroon, France,
      Italy, Senegal) and determined if a rhizosphere core microbiome existed across
      these different countries. The wheat genotype had a limited effect on the
      rhizosphere microbiome (2% of variance) as the majority of the microbial taxa
      were consistently associated to multiple wheat genotypes grown in the same soil. 
      Large differences in taxa richness and in community structure were observed
      between the eight soils studied (57% variance) and the two agricultural practices
      (10% variance). Despite these differences between soils, we observed that 177
      taxa (2 archaea, 103 bacteria, 41 fungi and 31 protists) were consistently
      detected in the rhizosphere, constituting a core microbiome. In addition to being
      prevalent, these core taxa were highly abundant and collectively represented 50% 
      of the reads in our data set. Based on these results, we identify a list of key
      taxa as future targets of culturomics, metagenomics and wheat synthetic
      microbiomes. Additionally, we show that protists are an integral part of the
      wheat holobiont that is currently overlooked.

      maize cropping systems.

AB  - Unraveling the key drivers of bacterial community assembly in agricultural soils 
      is pivotal for soil nutrient management and crop productivity. Presently, the
      drivers of microbial community structure remain unexplored in maize cropping
      systems under complex and variable environmental scenarios across large spatial
      scales. In this study, we conducted high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 
      network analysis to identify the major environmental factors driving bacterial
      community diversity and co-occurrence patterns in 21 maize field soils across
      China. The results show that mean annual precipitation and soil pH are the major 
      environmental factors that shape soil bacterial communities in maize soils. The
      similarities of bacterial communities significantly decreased with increasing
      geographic distance between different sites. The differences in spatial turnover 
      rates across bacterial phyla indicate the distinct dispersal capabilities of
      bacterial groups, and some abundant phyla exhibited high dispersal capabilities. 
      Aeromicrobium, Friedmanniella, Saccharothrix, Lamia, Rhodococcus, Skermanella,
      and Pedobacter were identified as keystone taxa. Based on the node-level and
      network-level topological features, members of the core microbiome were more
      frequently found in the center of the ecosystem network compared with other taxa.
      This study highlights the major environmental factors driving bacterial community
      assembly in agro-ecosystems and the central ecological role of the core
      microbiome in maintaining the web of complex bacterial interactions.

TI  - MetaEuk-sensitive, high-throughput gene discovery, and annotation for large-scale
      eukaryotic metagenomics.
PG  - 48
LID - 10.1186/s40168-020-00808-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Metagenomics is revolutionizing the study of microorganisms and their
      involvement in biological, biomedical, and geochemical processes, allowing us to 
      investigate by direct sequencing a tremendous diversity of organisms without the 
      need for prior cultivation. Unicellular eukaryotes play essential roles in most
      microbial communities as chief predators, decomposers, phototrophs, bacterial
      hosts, symbionts, and parasites to plants and animals. Investigating their roles 
      is therefore of great interest to ecology, biotechnology, human health, and
      evolution. However, the generally lower sequencing coverage, their more complex
      gene and genome architectures, and a lack of eukaryote-specific experimental and 
      computational procedures have kept them on the sidelines of metagenomics.
      RESULTS: MetaEuk is a toolkit for high-throughput, reference-based discovery, and
      annotation of protein-coding genes in eukaryotic metagenomic contigs. It performs
      fast searches with 6-frame-translated fragments covering all possible exons and
      optimally combines matches into multi-exon proteins. We used a benchmark of seven
      diverse, annotated genomes to show that MetaEuk is highly sensitive even under
      conditions of low sequence similarity to the reference database. To demonstrate
      MetaEuk's power to discover novel eukaryotic proteins in large-scale metagenomic 
      data, we assembled contigs from 912 samples of the Tara Oceans project. MetaEuk
      predicted >12,000,000 protein-coding genes in 8 days on ten 16-core servers. Most
      of the discovered proteins are highly diverged from known proteins and originate 
      from very sparsely sampled eukaryotic supergroups. CONCLUSION: The open-source
      (GPLv3) MetaEuk software (https://github.com/soedinglab/metaeuk) enables
      large-scale eukaryotic metagenomics through reference-based, sensitive taxonomic 
      and functional annotation. Video abstract.

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8030443 [doi]
AB  - We assessed the diversity, structure, and assemblage of bacterial and fungal
      communities associated with banana plants with and without Fusarium oxysporum f. 
      sp. cubense (Foc) symptoms. A total of 117,814 bacterial and 17,317 fungal
      operational taxonomy units (OTUs) were identified in the rhizosphere, roots, and 
      corm of the host plant. Results revealed that bacterial and fungal microbiota
      present in roots and corm primarily emanated from the rhizosphere. The
      composition of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere, roots, and corm were
      different, with more diversity observed in the rhizosphere and less in the corm. 
      However, distinct sample types i.e., without (asymptomatic) and with
      (symptomatic) Fusarium symptoms were the major drivers of the fungal community
      composition. Considering the high relative abundance among samples, we identified
      core microbiomes with bacterial and fungal OTUs classified into 20 families and
      colonizing distinct plant components of banana. Our core microbiome assigned 129 
      bacterial and 37 fungal genera to known taxa.

AB  - Direct evidence in humans for the impact of the microbiome on nutrient absorption
      is lacking. We conducted an extended inpatient study using two interventions that
      we hypothesized would alter the gut microbiome and nutrient absorption. In each, 
      stool calorie loss, a direct proxy of nutrient absorption, was measured. The
      first phase was a randomized cross-over dietary intervention in which all
      participants underwent in random order 3 d of over- and underfeeding. The second 
      was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pharmacologic intervention
      using oral vancomycin or matching placebo (NCT02037295). Twenty-seven volunteers 
      (17 men and 10 women, age 35.1 +/- 7.3, BMI 32.3 +/- 8.0), who were healthy other
      than having impaired glucose tolerance and obesity, were enrolled and 25
      completed the entire trial. The primary endpoints were the effects of dietary and
      pharmacological intervention on stool calorie loss. We hypothesized that stool
      calories expressed as percentage of caloric intake would increase with
      underfeeding compared with overfeeding and increase during oral vancomycin
      treatment. Both primary endpoints were met. Greater stool calorie loss was
      observed during underfeeding relative to overfeeding and during vancomycin
      treatment compared with placebo. Key secondary endpoints were to evaluate the
      changes in gut microbial community structure as evidenced by amplicon sequencing 
      and metagenomics. We observed only a modest perturbation of gut microbial
      community structure with under- versus overfeeding but a more widespread change
      in community structure with reduced diversity with oral vancomycin. Increase in
      Akkermansia muciniphila was common to both interventions that resulted in greater
      stool calorie loss. These results indicate that nutrient absorption is sensitive 
      to environmental perturbations and support the translational relevance of
      preclinical models demonstrating a possible causal role for the gut microbiome in
      dietary energy harvest.

TI  - Gut Microbiomes of Endangered Przewalski's Horse Populations in Short- and
      Long-Term Captivity: Implication for Species Reintroduction Based on the
      Soft-Release Strategy.
PG  - 363
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00363 [doi]
AB  - Captivity maybe the only choice for survival of many endangered vertebrates, and 
      understanding its broad effects is important for animal management and
      conservation, including breeding endangered species for subsequent release.
      Extreme environmental changes during captivity may influence survival ability in 
      the wild. Captivity decreases gut bacterial diversity in a wide range of animals.
      However, most studies directly compare animals living in captivity with those in 
      the wild, and there is a lack of understanding of effects of gradient shift in
      lifestyle during species reintroduction based on the soft-release strategy, which
      involves a confinement period in a field enclosure. Here, we used 16S rRNA
      amplicon sequencing to analyze gut microbiomes of 11 captive and 12 semi-wild
      Przewalski's horses (PH; Equus ferus przewalskii) under the same captivity
      environment, using fecal samples. A subset of samples with abundant extracted DNA
      (including 3 captive and 3 semi-wild individuals) was selected for whole-genome
      shotgun sequencing. We found that community diversity did not differ between the 
      semi-wild PH and captive PH, but the semi-wild PH had significantly higher
      bacterial richness than those in captivity. Relative abundances of all dominant
      phyla were similar across the semi-wild or captive horses, while those of the
      non-dominant phyla Tenericutes and Proteobacteria were significantly higher in
      semi-wild PH than in captive PH. Beta diversity results indicated that bacterial 
      communities of captives and semi-wild horses were clearly separated distinct when
      considering only composition. Functional profiling of the microbiomes revealed
      that the semi-wild and captive gut microbiomes were largely similar. However,
      semi-wild horse microbiomes had higher abundance of bacterial genes related to
      core metabolic processes, such as carbohydrates, amino acids, and nucleic acid
      metabolism. The study revealed that semi-wild PH could retain specific
      non-dominant bacteria and harbor a more diverse microbiome than the captive
      counterpart, and thus have higher metabolic potential to utilize the complex
      plants efficiently. These results indicate that change in host lifestyle may play
      a role in microbiome differentiation in the process of reintroduction, suggesting
      that a short period of time in captivity is acceptable for PH from the
      perspective of maintaining the richness of intestinal bacterial flora to some
      extent.

TI  - Regional and oyster microenvironmental scale heterogeneity in the Pacific oyster 
      bacterial community.
LID - fiaa054 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiaa054 [doi]
AB  - Different organs of a host represent distinct microenvironments resulting in the 
      establishment of multiple discrete bacterial communities within a host. These
      discrete bacterial communities can also vary according to geographical location. 
      For the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, the factors governing bacterial
      diversity and abundance of different oyster microenvironments are poorly
      understood. In this study, the factors shaping bacterial abundance, diversity and
      composition associated with the C. gigas mantle, gill, adductor muscle and
      digestive gland were characterised using 16S (V3-V4) rRNA amplicon sequencing
      across six discrete estuaries. Both location and tissue-type, with tissue-type
      being the stronger determinant, were factors driving bacterial community
      composition. Bacterial communities from wave-dominated estuaries had similar
      compositions and higher bacterial abundance despite being geographically distant 
      from one another, possibly indicating that functional estuarine morphology
      characteristics are a factor shaping the oyster bacterial community. Despite the 
      bacterial community heterogeneity, examinations of the core bacterial community
      identified Spirochaetaceae bacteria as conserved across all sites and samples.
      Whereas members of the Vulcaniibacterium, Spirochaetaceae and Margulisbacteria,
      and Polynucleobacter were regionally conserved members of the digestive gland,
      gill and mantle bacterial communities, respectively. This indicates that baseline
      bacterial community profiles for specific locations are necessary when
      investigating bacterial communities in oyster health.

TI  - Characterisation of the gut microbial community of rhesus macaques in
      high-altitude environments.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/s12866-020-01747-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mammal intestinal microbiota is involved in various physiological
      processes and plays a key role in host environment adaption. However, for
      non-human primates (NHPs), little is known about their gut microbial community in
      high-altitude environments and even less about their adaption to such habitats.
      We characterised the gut microbial community of rhesus macaques from multiple
      high-altitude environments and compared it to those of low-altitude populations. 
      RESULTS: We collected faecal samples of rhesus macaques from four high-altitude
      populations (above 3000 m) and three low-altitude populations (below 500 m). By
      calculating the alpha diversity index, we found that high-altitude populations
      exhibited a higher diversity. Statistical analysis of beta diversity indicated
      significant differences between high- and low-altitude populations. Significant
      differences were also detected at the phylum and family levels. At the phylum
      level, the high-altitude gut microbial community was dominated by Firmicutes
      (63.42%), while at low altitudes, it was dominated by Bacteroidetes (47.4%). At
      the family level, the high-altitude population was dominated by Ruminococcaceae
      (36.2%), while the low-altitude one was dominated by Prevotellaceae (39.6%). Some
      families, such as Christensenellaceae and Rikenellaceae, were consistently higher
      abundant in all high-altitude populations. We analysed the overlap of operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) in high-altitude populations and determined their core
      OTUs (shared by all four high-altitude populations). However, when compared with 
      the low-altitude core OTUs, only 65% were shared, suggesting a divergence in core
      OTUs. Function prediction indicated a significant difference in gene copy number 
      of 35 level-2 pathways between high- and low-altitude populations; 29 of them
      were higher in high altitudes, especially in membrane transport and carbohydrate 
      metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: The gut microbial community of high-altitude rhesus
      macaques was significantly distinct from that of low-altitude populations in
      terms of diversity, composition and function. High-altitude populations were
      dominated by Firmicutes and Ruminococcace, while in low-altitude populations,
      Bacteroidetes and Prevotellaceae were dominant. The difference in gut microbiota 
      between these two populations may be caused by differences in host diet,
      environmental temperature and oxygen pressure. These differentiated gut microbial
      microorganisms may play a critical role in the adaptive evolution of rhesus
      macaques to high-altitude environments.

PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/s12866-020-01745-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Daqu, the saccharification, fermentation, and aroma-producing agents 
      for Baijiu brewing, is prepared using a complex process. Aging is important for
      improving the quality of Daqu, but its impact has rarely been studied. This study
      investigated changes in the physicochemical properties, flavor compounds, and
      microbial communities during aging of Daqu with a roasted sesame-like flavor.
      RESULTS: The physicochemical properties changed continuously during aging to
      provide a high esterifying activity. Aging removed unpleasant flavor compounds
      and helped to stabilize the flavor compounds in mature Daqu. A high-throughput
      sequencing approach was used to analyze the changing composition of the microbial
      communities during aging. Aging helped to modify the microbial population to
      produce better Baijiu by eliminating low-abundance microbial communities and
      optimizing the proportion of predominant microbial communities. Nine genera of
      prokaryotic microbes formed the core microbiota in Daqu after aging. Regarding
      eukaryotic microbes, Zygomycota, the predominant community, increased in the
      first 2 months, then decreased in the third month of aging, while Ascomycota, the
      subdominant community, showed the opposite behavior. Absidia,
      Trichocomaceae_norank and Rhizopus were the predominant genera in the mature
      Daqu. CONCLUSIONS: Significant correlations between microbiota and
      physicochemical properties or flavor compounds were observed, indicating that
      optimizing microbial communities is essential for aging Daqu. This study provides
      detailed information on aging during Daqu preparation.

TI  - Under the Christmas Tree: Belowground Bacterial Associations With Abies
      nordmanniana Across Production Systems and Plant Development.
PG  - 198
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00198 [doi]
AB  - Abies nordmanniana is an economically important tree crop widely used for
      Christmas tree production. After initial growth in nurseries, seedlings are
      transplanted to the field. Rhizosphere bacterial communities generally impact the
      growth and health of the host plant. However, the dynamics of these communities
      during A. nordmanniana growth in nurseries, and during transplanting, has not
      previously been addressed. By a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approach, we
      characterized the composition and dynamics of bacterial communities in the
      rhizosphere during early plant growth in field and greenhouse nurseries and for
      plants transplanted from the greenhouse to the field. Moreover, the N-cycling
      potential of rhizosphere bacteria across plant age was addressed in both
      nurseries. Overall, a rhizosphere core microbiome of A. nordmanniana, comprising 
      19.9% of the taxa at genus level, was maintained across plant age, nursery
      production systems, and even during the transplantation of plants from the
      greenhouse to the field. The core microbiome included the bacterial genera
      Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium,
      Rhodanobacter, and Sphingomonas, which harbor several N-fixing and plant
      growth-promoting taxa. Nevertheless, both plant age and production system caused 
      significant changes in the rhizosphere bacterial communities. Concerning
      community composition, the relative abundance of Rhizobiales (genera Rhizobium,
      Bradyrhizobium, and Devosia) was higher in the rhizosphere of field-grown A.
      nordmanniana, whereas the relative abundance of Enterobacteriales and
      Pseudomonadales (genus Pseudomonas) was higher in the greenhouse. Analysis of
      community dynamics across plant age showed that in the field nursery, the most
      abundant bacterial orders showed more dynamic changes in their relative abundance
      in the rhizosphere than in the bulk soil. In the greenhouse, age-dependent
      dynamics even occurred but affected different taxa than for the field-grown
      plants. The N-cycling potential of rhizosphere bacterial communities showed an
      increase of the relative abundance of genes involved in nitrogen fixation and
      denitrification by plant age. Similarly, the relative abundance of reported
      nitrogen-fixing or denitrifying bacteria increased by plant age. However,
      different community structures seemed to lead to an increased potential for
      nitrogen fixation and denitrification in the field versus greenhouse nurseries.

TI  - Mesorhizobium alexandrii sp. nov., isolated from phycosphere microbiota of
      PSTs-producing marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum amtk4.

AB  - An aerobic, Gram-stain-negative, motile and rod-shaped bacterial strain,
      designated as Z1-4(T), was isolated from the phycosphere microbiota of marine
      dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum that produces paralytic shellfish poisoning
      toxins. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the
      new isolate belongs to the genus Mesorhizobium, and it was closely related to
      Mesorhizobium waimense LMG 28228(T) and Mesorhizobium amorphae LMG 18977(T) with 
      both 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 97.3%. The values of average
      nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) relatedness
      between strain Z1-4(T) and its relatives are both well below the thresholds used 
      for the delineation of a new species. A genome-based phylogenetic tree
      constructed by up-to-date bacterial core gene set (UBCG) indicates that strain
      Z1-4(T) forms an independent branch within the genus Mesorhizobium. The
      respiratory quinone of strain Z1-4(T) was Q-10. The major fatty acids were
      similar to other members of the genus Mesorhizobium containing the summed feature
      8, C16:0, C19:0cycloomega8c, C17:0 and summed feature 3. The polar lipids are
      phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, 
      phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified
      aminophospholipid, five glycolipids and seven unknown polar lipids. The DNA G + C
      content was determined to be 62.1 mol % based on its genomic sequence. Combined
      evidences based on the genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics
      clearly indicates that strain Z1-4(T) represents a novel species of the genus
      Mesorhizobium, for which the name Mesorhizobium alexandrii sp. nov. is proposed. 
      The type strain is Z1-4(T) (= KCTC 72512(T) = CCTCC AB 2019101(T)).

LID - 10.3389/fpls.2020.00203 [doi]
AB  - Plant-associated microbial communities play a central role in the plant response 
      to biotic and abiotic stimuli, improving plant fitness under challenging growing 
      conditions. Many studies have focused on the characterization of changes in
      abundance and composition of root-associated microbial communities as a
      consequence of the plant response to abiotic factors such as altered soil
      nutrients and drought. However, changes in composition in response to abiotic
      factors are still poorly understood concerning the endophytic community
      associated to the phyllosphere, the above-ground plant tissues. In the present
      study, we applied high-throughput 16S rDNA gene sequencing of the phyllosphere
      endophytic bacterial communities colonizing wild Populus trichocarpa (black
      cottonwood) plants growing in native, nutrient-limited environments characterized
      by hot-dry (xeric) riparian zones (Yakima River, WA), riparian zones with mid
      hot-dry (Tieton and Teanaway Rivers, WA) and moist (mesic) climates (Snoqualmie, 
      Skykomish and Skagit Rivers, WA). From sequencing data, 587 Amplicon Sequence
      Variants (ASV) were identified. Surprisingly, our data show that a core
      microbiome could be found in phyllosphere-associated endophytic communities in
      trees growing on opposite sides of the Cascades Mountain Range. Considering only 
      taxa appearing in at least 90% of all samples within each climatic zone, the core
      microbiome was dominated only by two ASVs affiliated Pseudomonadaceae and two
      ASVs of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Alpha-diversity measures indicated that
      plants colonizing hot-dry environments showed a lower diversity than those from
      mid hot-dry and moist climates. Beta-diversity measures showed that bacterial
      composition was significantly different across sampling sites. Accordingly, we
      found that specific ASV affiliated to Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae
      were significantly more abundant in the phyllosphere endophytic community
      colonizing plants adapted to the xeric environment. In summary, this study
      highlights that sampling site is the major driver of variation and that only a
      few ASV showed a distribution that significantly correlated to climate variables.

TI  - Characterization of the Gut Microbiota of the Antarctic Heart Urchin
      (Spatangoida) Abatus agassizii.
PG  - 308
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00308 [doi]
AB  - Abatus agassizii is an irregular sea urchin species that inhabits shallow waters 
      of South Georgia and South Shetlands Islands. As a deposit-feeder, A. agassizii
      nutrition relies on the ingestion of the surrounding sediment in which it lives
      barely burrowed. Despite the low complexity of its feeding habit, it harbors a
      long and twice-looped digestive tract suggesting that it may host a complex
      bacterial community. Here, we characterized the gut microbiota of specimens from 
      two A. agassizii populations at the south of the King George Island in the West
      Antarctic Peninsula. Using a metabarcoding approach targeting the 16S rRNA gene, 
      we characterized the Abatus microbiota composition and putative functional
      capacity, evaluating its differentiation among the gut content and the gut tissue
      in comparison with the external sediment. Additionally, we aimed to define a core
      gut microbiota between A. agassizii populations to identify potential keystone
      bacterial taxa. Our results show that the diversity and the composition of the
      microbiota, at both genetic and predicted functional levels, were mostly driven
      by the sample type, and to a lesser extent by the population location. Specific
      bacterial taxa, belonging mostly to Planctomycetacia and Spirochaetia, were
      differently enriched in the gut content and the gut tissue, respectively.
      Predictive functional profiles revealed higher abundance of specific pathways, as
      the sulfur cycle in the gut content and the amino acid metabolism, in the gut
      tissue. Further, the definition of a core microbiota allowed to obtain evidence
      of specific localization of bacterial taxa and the identification of potential
      keystone taxa assigned to the Desulfobacula and Spirochaeta genera as potentially
      host selected. The ecological relevance of these keystone taxa in the host
      metabolism is discussed.

TI  - Agroforestry Management Systems Drive the Composition, Diversity, and Function of
      Fungal and Bacterial Endophyte Communities in Theobroma Cacao Leaves.
LID - E405 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8030405 [doi]
AB  - Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is one of the most economically important crops
      worldwide. Despite the important role of endophytes for plant growth and health, 
      very little is known about the effect of agroforestry management systems on the
      endophyte communities of T. cacao. To close this knowledge gap, we investigated
      the diversity, community composition, and function of bacterial and fungal
      endophytes in the leaves of T. cacao trees growing in five major cacao-growing
      regions in the central region of Cameroon using DNA metabarcoding. Fungal but not
      bacterial alpha diversity measures differed significantly between the
      agroforestry management systems. Interestingly, less managed home-garden cacao
      forests harbored the lowest fungal richness and diversity. Our results suggest
      that the composition of bacterial and fungal endophyte communities is
      predominantly affected by agroforestry management systems and, to a lesser
      extent, by environmental properties. The core microbiome detected comprised
      important fungal phytopathogens, such as Lasiodiplodia species. Several predicted
      pathways of bacterial endophytes and functional guilds of fungal endophytes
      differed between the agroforest systems which might be attributed to bacteria and
      fungi specifically associated with a single agroforest. Our results provide the
      basis for future studies on foliar fungal and bacterial endophytes of T. cacao
      and their responsiveness towards agroforestry management systems.

AB  - Micropollutants have become of great concern, because of their disrupting effects
      on the structure and function of microbial communities. However, little is known 
      about the relative importance of trace micropollutants on the aquatic prokaryotic
      communities as compared to the traditional physico-chemical characteristics,
      especially at different spatial dimensions. Here, we investigated free-living
      (FL) and particle-associated (PA) prokaryotic communities in a subtropical water 
      reservoir, China, across seasons at horizontal (surface water) and vertical
      (depth-profile) scales by using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Our results
      showed that the shared variances of physico-chemicals and micropollutants
      explained majority of the spatial variations in prokaryotic communities,
      suggesting a strong joint effect of the two abiotic categories on reservoir
      prokaryotic communities. Micropollutants appeared to exert strong independent
      influence on the core sub-communities (i.e., abundant and wide-spread taxa) than 
      on the satellite (i.e., less abundant and narrow-range taxa) counterparts. The
      pure effect of micropollutants on both core and satellite sub-communities from FL
      and PA fractions was ~1.5 folds greater than that of physico-chemical factors at 
      the horizontal scale, whereas an opposite effect was observed at the vertical
      scale. Moreover, eight micropollutants including anti-fungal agents, antibiotics,
      bisphenol analogues, stimulant and UV-filter were identified as the major
      disrupting compounds with strong associations with core taxa of typical
      freshwater prokaryotes. Altogether, we concluded that the ecological disrupting
      effects of micropollutants on prokaryotic communities may vary along horizontal
      and vertical dimensions in freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Lifting the veil on arid-to-hyperarid Antarctic soil microbiomes: a tale of two
      oases.
PG  - 37
LID - 10.1186/s40168-020-00809-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resident soil microbiota play key roles in sustaining the core
      ecosystem processes of terrestrial Antarctica, often involving unique taxa with
      novel functional traits. However, the full scope of biodiversity and the
      niche-neutral processes underlying these communities remain unclear. In this
      study, we combine multivariate analyses, co-occurrence networks and fitted
      species abundance distributions on an extensive set of bacterial, micro-eukaryote
      and archaeal amplicon sequencing data to unravel soil microbiome patterns of nine
      sites across two east Antarctic regions, the Vestfold Hills and Windmill Islands.
      To our knowledge, this is the first microbial biodiversity report on the
      hyperarid Vestfold Hills soil environment. RESULTS: Our findings reveal distinct 
      regional differences in phylogenetic composition, abundance and richness amongst 
      microbial taxa. Actinobacteria dominated soils in both regions, yet Bacteroidetes
      were more abundant in the Vestfold Hills compared to the Windmill Islands, which 
      contained a high abundance of novel phyla. However, intra-region comparisons
      demonstrate greater homogeneity of soil microbial communities and measured
      environmental parameters between sites at the Vestfold Hills. Community richness 
      is largely driven by a variable suite of parameters but robust associations
      between co-existing members highlight potential interactions and sharing of niche
      space by diverse taxa from all three microbial domains of life examined. Overall,
      non-neutral processes appear to structure the polar soil microbiomes studied
      here, with niche partitioning being particularly strong for bacterial communities
      at the Windmill Islands. Eukaryotic and archaeal communities reveal weaker
      niche-driven signatures accompanied by multimodality, suggesting the emergence of
      neutrality. CONCLUSION: We provide new information on assemblage patterns,
      environmental drivers and non-random occurrences for Antarctic soil microbiomes, 
      particularly the Vestfold Hills, where basic diversity, ecology and life history 
      strategies of resident microbiota are largely unknown. Greater understanding of
      these basic ecological concepts is a pivotal step towards effective conservation 
      management.

TI  - Comparative analysis and gut bacterial community assemblages of grass carp and
      crucian carp in new lineages from the Dongting Lake area.
PG  - e996
LID - 10.1002/mbo3.996 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbiota are known to play an important role in health and nutrition of the
      host and have been attracting an increasing attention. Farming of new lineages of
      grass carp and crucian carp has been developed rapidly as these species were
      found to outperform indigenous ones in terms of growth rate and susceptibility to
      diseases. Despite this rapid development, no studies have addressed the
      characteristics of their gut microbiota as a potential factor responsible for the
      improved characteristics. To reveal whether microbiomes of the new lineages are
      different from indigenous ones, and therefore could be responsible for improved
      growth features, intestinal microbiota from the new lineages were subjected to
      high-throughput sequencing. While the phyla Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and
      Proteobacteria were representing the core bacterial communities that comprised
      more than 75% in all fish intestinal samples, significant differences were found 
      in the microbial community composition of the new linages versus indigenous fish 
      populations, suggesting the possibility that results in the advantages of
      enhanced disease resistance and rapid growth for the new fish lineages. Bacterial
      composition was similar between herbivorous and omnivorous fish. The relative
      abundance of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria was significantly higher in
      omnivores compared to that of herbivores, whereas Cetobacterium_sp. was abundant 
      in herbivores. We also found that the gut microbiota of freshwater fish in the
      Dongting lake area was distinct from those of other areas. Network graphs showed 
      the reduced overall connectivity of gut bacteria in indigenous fish, whereas the 
      bacteria of the new fish lineage groups showed hubs with more node degree. A
      phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states 
      inferred function profile showed several metabolic processes were more active in 
      the new lineages compared to indigenous fish. Our findings suggest that
      differences in gut bacterial community composition may be an important factor
      contributing to the rapid growth and high disease resistance of the new fish
      lineages.

      physicochemical and sensory properties of cheese. In this study, the microbial
      compositions of different cheeses (Cheddar, provolone, and Swiss cheese) and
      cheese locations (core, rind, and mixed) collected from the Arbuthnot Dairy
      Center at Oregon State University were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon
      sequencing with the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). A total of
      225 operational taxonomic units were identified from the 4,675,187 sequencing
      reads generated. Streptococcus was observed to be the most abundant organism in
      provolone (72 to 85%) and Swiss (60 to 67%), whereas Lactococcus spp. were found 
      to dominate Cheddar cheese (27 to 76%). Species richness varied significantly by 
      cheese. According to alpha diversity analysis, porter-soaked Cheddar cheese
      exhibited the highest microbial richness, whereas smoked provolone cheese showed 
      the lowest. Rind regions of each cheese changed color through smoking and soaking
      for the beverage process. In addition, the microbial diversity of the rind region
      was higher than the core region because smoking and soaking processes directly
      contacted the rind region of each cheese. The microbial communities of the
      samples clustered by cheese, indicated that, within a given type of cheese,
      microbial compositions were very similar. Moreover, 34 operational taxonomic
      units were identified as biomarkers for different types of cheese through the
      linear discriminant analysis effect size method. Last, both carbohydrate and AA
      metabolites comprised more than 40% of the total functional annotated genes from 
      9 varieties of cheese samples. This study provides insight into the microbial
      composition of different types of cheese, as well as various locations within a
      cheese, which is applicable to its safety and sensory quality.

AB  - We investigated changes in rumen fermentation, the fluid bacterial community, and
      predicted functional pathway profiles in Holstein cows with and those without
      subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) during the periparturient period. Eighteen
      multiparous Holstein cows categorized in the SARA (n = 9) or non-SARA (n = 9)
      groups depending on whether they developed SARA during the 2 wk after
      parturition. Reticulo-ruminal pH was measured continuously throughout the study. 
      Rumen fluid and blood samples were collected 3 wk before and 2 and 6 wk after
      parturition, with an additional blood sample collected during the 0 and 4 wk
      after parturition. The 7-d mean reticulo-ruminal pH was significantly decreased
      in both groups postpartum compared with prepartum, with a greater and longer
      lasting change in the SARA group. The postpartum total volatile fatty acid
      concentration was significantly higher in the non-SARA than in SARA cows. Rumen
      bacterial richness and diversity were not affected by the periparturient period, 
      but the non-SARA group had a significantly higher Simpson diversity index
      postpartum. No significant change was observed in the composition of major
      bacterial phyla or genera during the periparturient period. Among 17 operational 
      taxonomic units (OTU) shared by all cows, the relative abundances of OTU36 (genus
      Pseudobutyrivibrio) in the SARA group and OTU4 (genus Prevotella) in the non-SARA
      group decreased significantly during the postpartum period compared with
      prepartum. In contrast, non-SARA cows had more diverse core bacterial OTU
      community including 23 additional OTU than those with SARA including 3 additional
      OTU (40 vs. 20 OTU). The OTU36 was significantly correlated with the proportion
      of iso-valeric acid (r = -0.353), and OTU4 was significantly correlated with the 
      7-d mean reticulo-ruminal pH (r = 0.432) and the proportions of acetic acid (r = 
      0.353) and propionic acid (r = -0.380). Prepartum, OTU2 (genus Prevotella) was
      the only OTU that differed significantly between the 2 groups. Changes in
      predicted functional pathway were primarily identified during the postpartum
      period, with 2 pathways upregulated at 3 wk prepartum and 24 upregulated and 34
      downregulated at 6 wk postpartum in the SARA group. Our results suggest that SARA
      incidence is not strictly related to changes in rumen fermentation or fluid
      bacterial community structure, but the predicted functional pathways of bacterial
      communities showed late responses to a postpartum decrease in reticulo-ruminal
      pH. Therefore, postpartum predicted functional pathway analysis may indicate the 
      underlying mechanisms causing SARA in Holstein cows during the periparturient
      period.

TI  - Does sociality drive diversity and composition of airway microbiota in cetaceans?
PG  - 324-333
LID - 10.1111/1758-2229.12835 [doi]
AB  - The number of social contacts of mammals is positively correlated with the
      diversity of their gut microbes. There is some evidence that sociality also
      affects microbes in the respiratory tract. We tested whether the airway
      microbiota of cetacean species differ depending on the whales' level of
      sociality. We sampled the blow of blue (Balaenoptera musculus), grey
      (Eschrichtius robustus), humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) and long-finned pilot 
      whales (PWs) (Globicephala melas) and analysed the blow microbiota by barcode tag
      sequencing targeting the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Humpback
      whales (HWs) show higher levels of sociality than blue (BW) and grey (GW), while 
      PWs are the most gregarious among the four species. The blow samples of the HWs
      showed the highest richness and diversity. HWs were also the only species with a 
      species-specific clustering of their microbial community composition and a
      relatively large number of core taxa. Therefore, we conclude that it cannot be
      sociality alone shaping the diversity and composition of airway microbiota. We
      suggest the whale species' lung volume and size of the plume of exhaled air as an
      additional factor impacting the transmission potential of blow microbiota from
      one individual whale to another.

TI  - Different Effects of Soil Fertilization on Bacterial Community Composition in the
      Penicillium canescens Hyphosphere and in Bulk Soil.
LID - e02969-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02969-19 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the effects of long-term soil fertilization on the
      composition and potential for phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) cycling of
      bacterial communities associated with hyphae of the P-solubilizing fungus
      Penicillium canescens Using a baiting approach, hyphosphere bacterial communities
      were recovered from three soils that had received long-term amendment in the
      field with mineral or mineral plus organic fertilizers. P. canescens hyphae
      recruited bacterial communities with a decreased diversity and an increased
      abundance of Proteobacteria relative to what was observed in soil communities. As
      core bacterial taxa, Delftia and Pseudomonas spp. were present in all hyphosphere
      samples irrespective of soil fertilization. However, the type of fertilization
      showed significant impacts on the diversity, composition, and distinctive
      taxa/operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of hyphosphere communities. The soil
      factors P (Olsen method), exchangeable Mg, exchangeable K, and pH were important 
      for shaping soil and hyphosphere bacterial community compositions. An increased
      relative abundance of organic P metabolism genes was found in hyphosphere
      communities from soil that had not received P fertilizers, which could indicate P
      limitation near the fungal hyphae. Additionally, P. canescens hyphae recruited
      bacterial communities with a higher abundance of N fixation genes than found in
      soil communities, which might imply a role of hyphosphere communities for fungal 
      N nutrition. Furthermore, the relative abundances of denitrification genes were
      greater in several hyphosphere communities, indicating an at least partly anoxic 
      microenvironment with a high carbon-to-N ratio around the hyphae. In conclusion, 
      soil fertilization legacy shapes P. canescens hyphosphere microbiomes and their
      functional potential related to P and N cycling.IMPORTANCE P-solubilizing
      Penicillium strains are introduced as biofertilizers to agricultural soils to
      improve plant P nutrition. Currently, little is known about the ecology of these 
      biofertilizers, including their interactions with other soil microorganisms. This
      study shows that communities dominated by Betaproteobacteria and
      Gammaproteobacteria colonize P. canescens hyphae in soil and that the
      compositions of these communities depend on the soil conditions. The potential of
      these communities for N and organic P cycling is generally higher than that of
      soil communities. The high potential for organic P metabolism might complement
      the ability of the fungus to solubilize inorganic P, and it points to the
      hyphosphere as a hot spot for P metabolism. Furthermore, the high potential for N
      fixation could indicate that P. canescens recruits bacteria that are able to
      improve its N nutrition. Hence, this community study identifies functional groups
      relevant for the future optimization of next-generation biofertilizer consortia
      for applications in soil.

TI  - Changes in the Intestinal Microbiota Are Seen Following Treatment with Infliximab
      in Children with Crohn's Disease.
LID - E687 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm9030687 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the impact of biological treatment with
      tumor necrosis factor alpha antibodies (anti-TNF-alpha) on the intestinal
      microbiome of children with severe Crohn's disease (CD) and to evaluate the
      differences in the intestinal microbiome between patients treated with biological
      therapy and healthy children. Microbiota composition was analyzed by 16S
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) and microbial profiles were compared between
      studied groups. Fifty-four samples (from 18 patients before and after
      anti-TNF-alpha induction therapy and 18 healthy children) were used in the
      sequencing analysis. Shannon's diversity index (p = 0.003, adj. p = 0.010) and
      observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (p = 0.007, adj. p = 0.015) were
      different between controls and patients with prior therapy for CD. Statistically 
      significant dissimilarities between beta diversity metrics, indicating distinct
      community composition across groups, were observed in patients with CD before and
      after therapy. We did not observe any differences between controls and patients
      with CD after therapy. Core microbiome analysis at species level showed that 32
      species were present only in patients with CD but not in controls. The results
      show that biological treatment is associated with changes in the intestinal

AB  - Microbiome research has increased dramatically in recent years, driven by
      advances in technology and significant reductions in the cost of analysis. Such
      research has unlocked a wealth of data, which has yielded tremendous insight into
      the nature of the microbial communities, including their interactions and
      effects, both within a host and in an external environment as part of an
      ecological community. Understanding the role of microbiota, including their
      dynamic interactions with their hosts and other microbes, can enable the
      engineering of new diagnostic techniques and interventional strategies that can
      be used in a diverse spectrum of fields, spanning from ecology and agriculture to
      medicine and from forensics to exobiology. From June 19-23 in 2017, the NIH and
      NSF jointly held an Innovation Lab on Quantitative Approaches to Biomedical Data 
      Science Challenges in our Understanding of the Microbiome. This review is
      inspired by some of the topics that arose as priority areas from this unique,
      interactive workshop. The goal of this review is to summarize the Innovation
      Lab's findings by introducing the reader to emerging challenges, exciting
      potential, and current directions in microbiome research. The review is broken
      into five key topic areas: (1) interactions between microbes and the human body, 
      (2) evolution and ecology of microbes, including the role played by the
      environment and microbe-microbe interactions, (3) analytical and mathematical
      methods currently used in microbiome research, (4) leveraging knowledge of
      microbial composition and interactions to develop engineering solutions, and (5) 
      interventional approaches and engineered microbiota that may be enabled by
      selectively altering microbial composition. As such, this review seeks to arm the
      reader with a broad understanding of the priorities and challenges in microbiome 
      research today and provide inspiration for future investigation and
      multi-disciplinary collaboration.

TI  - Disentangling the assembly mechanisms of ant cuticular bacterial communities of
      two Amazonian ant species sharing a common arboreal nest.
PG  - 1372-1385
LID - 10.1111/mec.15400 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria living on the cuticle of ants are generally studied for their protective
      role against pathogens, especially in the clade of fungus-growing ants. However, 
      little is known regarding the diversity of cuticular bacteria in other ant host
      species, as well as the mechanisms leading to the composition of these
      communities. Here, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to study the
      influence of host species, species interactions and the pool of bacteria from the
      environment on the assembly of cuticular bacterial communities on two
      phylogenetically distant Amazonian ant species that frequently nest together
      inside the roots system of epiphytic plants, Camponotus femoratus and
      Crematogaster levior. Our results show that (a) the vast majority of the
      bacterial community on the cuticle is shared with the nest, suggesting that most 
      bacteria on the cuticle are acquired through environmental acquisition, (b) 5.2% 
      and 2.0% of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are respectively specific to Ca.
      femoratus and Cr. levior, probably representing their respective core cuticular
      bacterial community, and (c) 3.6% of OTUs are shared between the two ant species.
      Additionally, mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis of metabolites on the
      cuticle of ants, which excludes the detection of cuticular hydrocarbons produced 
      by the host, were conducted to evaluate correlations among bacterial OTUs and m/z
      ion mass. Although some positive and negative correlations are found, the
      cuticular chemical composition was weakly species-specific, suggesting that
      cuticular bacterial communities are prominently environmentally acquired.
      Overall, our results suggest the environment is the dominant source of bacteria
      found on the cuticle of ants.

TI  - Milk Microbiota: What Are We Exactly Talking About?
PG  - 60
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2020.00060 [doi]
AB  - The development of powerful sequencing techniques has allowed, albeit with some
      biases, the identification and inventory of complex microbial communities that
      inhabit different body sites or body fluids, some of which were previously
      considered sterile. Notably, milk is now considered to host a complex microbial
      community with great diversity. Milk microbiota is now well documented in various
      hosts. Based on the growing literature on this microbial community, we address
      here the question of what milk microbiota is. We summarize and compare the
      microbial composition of milk in humans and in ruminants and address the
      existence of a putative core milk microbiota. We discuss the factors that
      contribute to shape the milk microbiota or affect its composition, including host
      and environmental factors as well as methodological factors, such as the sampling
      and sequencing techniques, which likely introduce distortion in milk microbiota
      analysis. The roles that milk microbiota are likely to play in the mother and
      offspring physiology and health are presented together with recent data on the
      hypothesis of an enteromammary pathway. At last, this fascinating field raises a 
      series of questions, which are listed and commented here and which open new
      research avenues.

      microbiota profiles.
LID - S0929-6646(20)30017-6 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jfma.2020.01.013 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Appropriate storage of fecal samples is a critical step for
      the unbiased analysis of microbial communities in metagenomic studies. Rapid
      freezing at -80 degrees C is usually considered to be best practice, but this
      approach is challenging. DNA stabilizing kits may provide a more convenient
      method to preserve and store clinical samples. We evaluated the reliability of
      two collection kits (Stratec stool collection tube with stabilizer, #1038111200
      and OMNIgene.GUT OMR-200) on preserving fecal microbiota. METHODS: Samples were
      collected from two locations of the fecal specimen, in four healthy volunteers.
      The samples were sub-aliquoted and stored in a -80 degrees C freezer, in Stratec 
      and OMNIgene.GUT (incubation at ambient temperature for 0, 3, or 7 days). The
      fecal microbial composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: We
      found that alpha diversity was not significantly affected by storage conditions. 
      Samples stored in DNA stabilizers were still representative of the original
      microbial community after 7 days at ambient temperature. Individual differences
      were found to have a greater contribution to the differences in microbial
      community composition than storage conditions or sampling location. Samples
      subjected to stabilizers displayed microbial community shifts compared with
      immediately frozen samples. A linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe)
      analysis showed that the relative abundances of Faecalibacterium were
      significantly higher in samples stored in Stratec kits. CONCLUSION: Our study
      reveals that both Stratec and OMNIgene.GUT kits provide good microbiome
      preservation for up to 7 days in ambient temperature and would represent good
      options for fecal sample collection in large scale, population-based studies.

AB  - Plants associate with numerous microbes, but little is known about how microbiome
      components, especially fungi, adapt to specific plant compartments. The
      adaptability of microbial function to the plant compartment is also not clear
      especially for woody species. Here, we characterized the bacterial and fungal
      communities in root endosphere, stems, and rhizospheres of 33 Broussonetia
      papyrifera seedlings, based on amplification of 16S and ITS rRNA. Results showed 
      that the alpha-diversity indexes of the bacterial community were significantly
      different in different plant compartments and they significantly increased from
      stem to root endosphere to the rhizosphere, whereas those of the fungal community
      were similar (p > 0.05). However, the result of constrained PCoA (CPCoA) and
      analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that both bacterial and fungal
      compositions were significantly affected by plant compartments (p < 0.01). In
      detail, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) distribution of the bacterial
      community was significantly different, but 249 of 252 fungal OTUs were shared in 
      different plant compartments. Both the bacterial and fungal compositions were
      significantly influenced by plant compartments, based on the result on phyla,
      core OTUs, and indicator OTUs level. Further, 40 of 42 enriched KEGG pathways
      involving the bacteria also differed significantly among plant compartments (p < 
      0.01). This study provides an understanding of the influence of plant
      compartments on the microbiome and confirms that the disperse limitation of
      fungal OTUs across different plant compartments is smaller. This study sheds
      light on how the microbial community adapts to and thrives in different plant
      compartments.

TI  - Nicotiana tabacum seed endophytic communities share a common core structure and
      genotype-specific signatures in diverging cultivars.
PG  - 287-295

AB  - Seed endophytes of crop plants have recently received increased attention due to 
      their implications in plant health and the potential to be included in
      agro-biotechnological applications. While previous studies indicated that plants 
      from the Solanaceae family harbor a highly diverse seed microbiome,
      genotype-specific effects on the community composition and structure remained
      largely unexplored. The present study revealed Enterobacteriaceae-dominated
      seed-endophytic communities in four Nicotiana tabacum L. cultivars originating
      from Brazil, China, and the USA. When the dissimilarity of bacterial communities 
      was assessed, none of the cultivars showed significant differences in microbial
      community composition. Various unusual endophyte signatures were represented by
      Spirochaetaceae family members and the genera Mycobacterium, Clostridium, and
      Staphylococcus. The bacterial fraction shared by all cultivars was dominated by
      members of the phyla Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. In total, 29 OTUs were
      present in all investigated cultivars and accounted for 65.5% of the combined
      core microbiome reads. Cultivars from the same breeding line were shown to share 
      a higher number of common OTUs than more distant lines. Moreover, the Chinese
      cultivar Yunyan 87 contained the highest number (33 taxa) of unique signatures.
      Our results indicate that a distinct proportion of the seed microbiome of N.
      tabacum remained unaffected by breeding approaches of the last century, while a
      substantial proportion co-diverged with the plant genotype. Moreover, they
      provide the basis to identify plant-specific endophytes that could be addressed
      for upcoming biotechnological approaches in agriculture.

TI  - Metabolic dependencies govern microbial syntrophies during methanogenesis in an
      anaerobic digestion ecosystem.
PG  - 22
LID - 10.1186/s40168-019-0780-9 [doi]
AB  - Methanogenesis, a biological process mediated by complex microbial communities,
      has attracted great attention due to its contribution to global warming and
      potential in biotechnological applications. The current study unveiled the core
      microbial methanogenic metabolisms in anaerobic vessel ecosystems by applying
      combined genome-centric metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. Here, we
      demonstrate that an enriched natural system, fueled only with acetate, could
      support a bacteria-dominated microbiota employing a multi-trophic methanogenic
      process. Moreover, significant changes, in terms of microbial structure and
      function, were recorded after the system was supplemented with additional H2.
      Methanosarcina thermophila, the predominant methanogen prior to H2 addition,
      simultaneously performed acetoclastic, hydrogenotrophic, and methylotrophic
      methanogenesis. The methanogenic pattern changed after the addition of H2, which 
      immediately stimulated Methanomicrobia-activity and was followed by a slow
      enrichment of Methanobacteria members. Interestingly, the essential genes
      involved in the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway were not expressed in bacterial members.
      The high expression of a glycine cleavage system indicated the activation of
      alternative metabolic pathways for acetate metabolism, which were reconstructed
      in the most abundant bacterial genomes. Moreover, as evidenced by predicted
      auxotrophies, we propose that specific microbes of the community were forming
      symbiotic relationships, thus reducing the biosynthetic burden of individual
      members. These results provide new information that will facilitate future
      microbial ecology studies of interspecies competition and symbiosis in
      methanogenic niches. Video abstract.

AB  - Dairy cattle are globally important agricultural animals. Central to their
      biology is the rumen, which houses an essential microbial community, or
      microbiome, important for providing nutrition from otherwise host-inaccessible
      dietary components. The rumen environment is noted for its substantial spatial
      heterogeneity, as illustrated by the stratification into ruminal solid and liquid
      phases. A third microbiota found directly attached to the ruminal epithelium (the
      epimural microbiota) also exists but is less well understood because of
      challenges in sampling the ruminal epithelium. As a result, our understanding of 
      the epimural microbiota is based on analyses of cannulated animals sampled at a
      single location-the ventral sac-and does not account for other ruminal locations,
      which may have importance for overall rumen function. To address this knowledge
      gap, we hypothesize that the epimural microbiota at different ruminal locations
      differs due to known morphological, physiological, and functional differences
      across the geographic spread of the rumen epithelium. Here, we characterized
      bacterial epimural communities at different sites within 8 lactating Holstein
      dairy cows using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Four different sites were sampled via 
      rumen tissue biopsy: cranial sac (CS), ventral sac (VS), caudodorsal blind sac
      (CDBS), and caudoventral blind sac (CVBS). We found that locations differed in
      both epimural bacterial community structure and composition, with the CDBS
      community displaying the greatest diversity. Across all sampling sites, epimural 
      bacterial communities were dominated by members of the phyla Bacteroidetes,
      Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria. Bacteria within Prevotellaceae, Butyrivibrio,
      Campylobacter, Mogibacterium, and Desulfobulbus all showed high relative sequence
      abundance and differential distributions according to sample location. There
      appears to be a core epimural microbiota present across all locations in all
      cows, although relative abundance was highly variable. The difference in relative
      abundance in epimural microbial communities, perhaps influenced by host
      physiology and the diversity within rumen contents, likely has important
      consequences for nutrition acquisition and general health. To the best of our
      knowledge, this work represents the first characterization of the ruminal
      epimural microbiota across different epithelial locations for any bovine
      ruminant.

AB  - Fecal microbes play an important role in the survival and health of wild animals.
      Spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) is one of the representative carnivores in
      Africa. In this study, we examined the fecal microflora of spotted hyena by
      conducting high-throughput sequencing of the fecal microbial 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 
      high mutation region. The effects of age, sex, and feeding environment on the
      fecal microbiota of spotted hyenas were determined. The results showed that the
      core bacteria phyla of spotted hyenas fecal microbiota include Firmicutes (at an 
      average relative abundance of 53.93%), Fusobacteria (19.56%), Bacteroidetes
      (11.40%), Actinobacteria (5.78%), and Proteobacteria (3.26%), etc. Age, gender,
      and feeding environment all had important effects on the fecal microbiota of
      spotted hyenas, among which feeding environment might be the most significant.
      The abundance of the Firmicutes in the adult group was significantly higher than 
      that in the juvenile group, whereas the abundance of Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes,
      and Proteobacteria were significantly lower than that in the juvenile group. The 
      abundance of Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae in the female group was
      significantly higher than that in the male group. There were significant
      differences between the fecal microbial communities of Jinan group and Weihai
      group, and microbes from the phyla Firmicutes and Synergistetes were
      representative species associated with the difference.

AB  - Understanding the basic biology that underpins soil microbiome interactions is
      required to predict the metaphenomic response to environmental shifts. A
      significant knowledge gap remains in how such changes affect microbial community 
      dynamics and their metabolic landscape at microbially relevant spatial scales.
      Using a custom-built SoilBox system, here we demonstrated changes in microbial
      community growth and composition in different soil environments (14%, 24%, and
      34% soil moisture), contingent upon access to reservoirs of nutrient sources. The
      SoilBox emulates the probing depth of a common soil core and enables
      determination of both the spatial organization of the microbial communities and
      their metabolites, as shown by confocal microscopy in combination with mass
      spectrometry imaging (MSI). Using chitin as a nutrient source, we used the
      SoilBox system to observe increased adhesion of microbial biomass on chitin
      islands resulting in degradation of chitin into N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and
      chitobiose. With matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-MSI, we also
      observed several phospholipid families that are functional biomarkers for
      microbial growth on the chitin islands. Fungal hyphal networks bridging different
      chitin islands over distances of 27 mm were observed only in the 14% soil
      moisture regime, indicating that such bridges may act as nutrient highways under 
      drought conditions. In total, these results illustrate a system that can provide 
      unprecedented spatial information about interactions within soil microbial
      communities as a function of changing environments. We anticipate that this
      platform will be invaluable in spatially probing specific intra- and interkingdom
      functional relationships of microbiomes within soil.IMPORTANCE Microbial
      communities are key components of the soil ecosystem. Recent advances in
      metagenomics and other omics capabilities have expanded our ability to
      characterize the composition and function of the soil microbiome. However,
      characterizing the spatial metabolic and morphological diversity of microbial
      communities remains a challenge due to the dynamic and complex nature of soil
      microenvironments. The SoilBox system, demonstrated in this work, simulates an
      approximately 12-cm soil depth, similar to a typical soil core, and provides a
      platform that facilitates imaging the molecular and topographical landscape of
      soil microbial communities as a function of environmental gradients. Moreover,
      the nondestructive harvesting of soil microbial communities for the imaging
      experiments can enable simultaneous multiomics analysis throughout the depth of
      the SoilBox. Our results show that by correlating molecular and optical imaging
      data obtained using the SoilBox platform, deeper insights into the nature of
      specific soil microbial interactions can be achieved.

AB  - Microbial activities are the dynamic core in the soil nutrient cycle. To improve 
      the knowledges about the responses of soil microbial community structure and
      potential function to long-term cover crops practice. The co-occurrence patterns 
      of soil microbial community structure and functional genes were evaluated using
      16SrRNA, ITS and metagenomic technique in 13 years cover crops of orchard grass
      (OG, Dactylis glomerata L.) with high C/N and white clover (WC, Trifolium repens 
      L.) with low C/N. Conventional tillage (CT) was control. The experiment was
      implemented in an apple orchard located on the Loess Plateau, China, from 2006 to
      2018. We also measured soil physicochemical properties and enzyme activities
      related to carbon and nitrogen cycling. The conclusions showed that the dominant 
      bacterial phyla were Actinobacteria 27.68% in OG treatment and Proteobacteria
      25.89% in WC treatment. Organic matter inputs stimulated growth of the phyla of
      Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Ascomycota and genera of Bacillus,
      Blastococcus, Streptomyces and Penicillium. Interestingly, the OG and WC
      treatments promoted the fungal and bacterial alpha-diversity compared to CT
      treatment, respectively. In addition, compared to CT treatment, OG treatment was 
      beneficial to the increase of C-cycle enzyme activity, while WC treatment tended 
      to increase the N-cycle enzyme activity. Notably, compared to CT treatment, they 
      both enriched carbon fixation and cycle pathways genes, while WC treatment
      increased the nitrogen metabolism pathway genes. Moreover, OG treatment was more 
      conducive to the enrichment of carbohydrate enzymes genes involved in the
      hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose compared to WC treatment. Overall,
      different quality of plant residues stimulated the specific expressions of soil
      microbial community structure and function. Long-term planted white clover was
      effective strategy to improve soil quality.

AB  - In a desert, plants as holobionts quickly respond to resource pulses like
      precipitation. However, little is known on how environment and plants modulate
      the rhizosphere-associated microbiome. As a model species to represent the
      Atacama Desert bloom, Cistanthe longiscapa (Montiaceae family) was selected to
      study the influence of abiotic and biotic environment on the diversity and
      structure of the microbiota associated to its rhizosphere. We analyzed the
      rhizosphere and soil microbiome along a North-South precipitation gradient and
      between a dry and rainy year by using Illumina high-throughput sequencing of 16S 
      rRNA gene fragments and ITS2 regions for prokaryotes and fungi, respectively. In 
      the rhizosphere of C. longiscapa the microbiota clearly differs in composition
      and structure from the surrounding bulk soil. The fungal and bacterial
      communities respond differently to environmental conditions. The diversity and
      richness of fungal OTUs were negatively correlated with aridity, as predicted.
      The community structure was predominantly influenced by other soil
      characteristics (pH, organic matter content) but not by aridity. In contrast,
      diversity, composition, and structure of the bacterial community were not
      influenced by aridity or any other evaluated soil parameter. These findings
      coincide with the identification of mainly site-specific microbial communities,
      not shared along the sites. These local communities contain a group of OTUs,
      which are exclusive to the rhizosphere of each site and presumably vertically
      inherited as seed endophytes. Their ecological functions and dispersal mechanisms
      remain unclear. The analysis of co-occurrence patterns highlights the strong
      effect of the desert habitat over the soil- and rhizosphere-microbiome. The
      site-independent enrichment of only a small bacterial cluster consistently
      associated with the rhizosphere of C. longiscapa further supports this
      conclusion. In a rainy year, the rhizosphere microbiota significantly differed
      from bulk and bare soil, whereas in a dry year, the community structure of the
      former rhizosphere approximates to the one found in the bulk. In the context of
      plant-microbe interactions in desert environments, our study contributes new
      insights into the importance of aridity in microbial community structure and
      composition, discovering the influence of other soil parameters in this complex
      dynamic network, which needs further to be investigated.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of intramammary pirlimycin 
      on the fecal microbiome of dairy cattle. Primiparous heifers were enrolled and
      assigned to a treatment or control group at a ratio of 2:1. In part 1 of the
      study, treated heifers (T1) were given intramammary pirlimycin into one infected 
      quarter once daily for 2 d at 24-h intervals, according to the label
      instructions. Control heifers received no treatment. In part 2 of the study,
      treated heifers (T2) were given intramammary pirlimycin into one infected quarter
      once daily for 8 d at 24-h intervals, according to the label instructions. All
      enrolled heifers (T1, T2, and control) had quarter-level milk samples aseptically
      collected for bacterial culture and fecal samples collected for 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing on d 0, 2, 7, 14, 21, and 28. Milk samples were plated on Columbia
      blood agar and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. Bacteria were identified using
      MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The DNA was extracted from feces using PowerFecal
      kits (Qiagen, Venlo, the Netherlands). The 16S rRNA gene amplicon library
      construction and sequencing was performed at the University of Missouri DNA Core 
      facility. Testing for differences in fecal community composition was performed
      via one-way permutational multivariate ANOVA of Bray-Curtis and Jaccard
      similarities using Past 3.13 (https://folk.uio.no/ohammer/past/). Mean total
      count of operational taxonomic units and Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson
      alpha-diversity indices were determined and compared via t-test or Wilcoxon rank 
      sum test. A treatment-dependent effect was present in the observed and predicted 
      richness of feces from cows in the T1 group at d 2 posttreatment. Additionally,
      intramammary pirlimycin induced a significant change in the composition of the
      fecal microbiota by d 2 in the treated groups. Based on calculated intra-subject 
      similarities, intramammary pirlimycin was associated with a significant acute
      change in the fecal microbiota of dairy heifers and that chance reversed when the
      antimicrobial exposure was brief, but sustained following longer exposure.
      Overall, intramammary pirlimycin administration affected the fecal microbiome of 
      lactating dairy heifers. Further work is necessary to determine the effect of
      these changes on the heifer and the dairy environment as well as if treatment is 
      influencing antimicrobial resistance among enteric and environmental bacteria.

      control of bacteria-induced clogging during geothermal water recharge. Based on a
      series of laboratory-scale percolation experiments, the variations in bacterial
      community diversity, composition, and structure were investigated during
      simulated geothermal water recharge using high-throughput sequencing technology. 
      The Chao, Shannon, and Evenness indexes were used to quantify the richness,
      diversity, and evenness of the bacterial community, respectively. The results
      show that the richness of the bacterial community initially increased and then
      decreased in the sand columns during the experiments of geothermal water
      recharge, while the changes in bacterial diversity and evenness were not
      apparent. A variety of bacterial phyla were found, among which Proteobacteria was
      predominant (88.31%), followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes
      (4.23%, 3.44%, and 2.49%). For the non-Proteobacterial phyla, Actinobacteria
      gradually disappeared while Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were detected during the
      percolation experiments. This study implies that, despite the variations in the
      bacterial community, a core group of bacteria persists during geothermal water
      recharge, and thus a targeted control of bacteria-induced clogging during
      geothermal water recharge should be feasible.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neointimal hyperplasia is a major contributor to restenosis after
      arterial interventions, but the genetic and environmental mechanisms underlying
      the variable propensity for neointimal hyperplasia between individuals, including
      the role of commensal microbiota, are not well understood. We sought to
      characterize how shifting the microbiome using cage sharing and bedding mixing
      between rats with differing restenosis phenotypes after carotid artery balloon
      angioplasty could alter arterial remodeling. METHODS: We co-housed and mixed
      bedding between genetically distinct rats (Lewis [LE] and Sprague-Dawley [SD])
      that harbor different commensal microbes and that are known to have different
      neointimal hyperplasia responses to carotid artery balloon angioplasty.
      Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was used to monitor changes in the gut
      microbiome. RESULTS: There were significant differences in neointimal hyperplasia
      between non-co-housed LE and SD rats 14 days after carotid artery angioplasty
      (mean intima + media [I + M] area, 0.117 +/- 0.014 mm(2) LE vs 0.275 +/- 0.021
      mm(2) SD; P < .001) that were diminished by co-housing. Co-housing also altered
      local adventitial Ki67 immunoreactivity, local accumulation of leukocytes and
      macrophages (total and M2), and interleukin 17A concentration 3 days after
      surgery in each strain. Non-co-housed SD and LE rats had microbiomes
      distinguished by both weighted (P = .012) and unweighted (P < .001) UniFrac beta 
      diversity distances, although without significant differences in alpha diversity.
      The difference in unweighted beta diversity between the fecal microbiota of SD
      and LE rats was significantly reduced by co-housing. Operational taxonomic units 
      that significantly correlated with average I + M area include Parabacteroides
      distasonis, Desulfovibrio, Methanosphaera, Peptococcus, and Prevotella. Finally, 
      serum concentrations of microbe-derived metabolites hydroxyanthranilic acid and
      kynurenine/tryptophan ratio were significantly associated with I + M area in both
      rat strains independent of co-housing. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel mechanism
      for how microbiome manipulations affect arterial remodeling and the inflammatory 
      response after arterial injury. A greater understanding of the host
      inflammatory-microbe axis could uncover novel therapeutic targets for the
      prevention and treatment of restenosis.

TI  - Duckweed hosts a taxonomically similar bacterial assemblage as the terrestrial
      leaf microbiome.

AB  - Culture-independent characterization of microbial communities associated with
      popular plant model systems have increased our understanding of the plant
      microbiome. However, the integration of other model systems, such as duckweed,
      could facilitate our understanding of plant microbiota assembly and evolution.
      Duckweeds are floating aquatic plants with many characteristics, including small 
      size and reduced plant architecture, that suggest their use as a facile model
      system for plant microbiome studies. Here, we investigated the structure and
      assembly of the duckweed bacterial microbiome. First, a culture-independent
      survey of the duckweed bacterial microbiome from different locations in New
      Jersey revealed similar phylogenetic profiles. These studies showed that
      Proteobacteria is a dominant phylum in the duckweed bacterial microbiome. To
      observe the assembly dynamics of the duckweed bacterial community, we inoculated 
      quasi-gnotobiotic duckweed with wastewater effluent from a municipal wastewater
      treatment plant. Our results revealed that duckweed strongly shapes its bacterial
      microbiome and forms distinct associations with bacterial community members from 
      the initial inoculum. Additionally, these inoculation studies showed the
      bacterial communities of different duckweed species were similar in taxa
      composition and abundance. Analysis across the different duckweed bacterial
      communities collected in this study identified a set of "core" bacterial taxa
      consistently present on duckweed irrespective of the locale and context.
      Furthermore, comparison of the duckweed bacterial community to that of rice and
      Arabidopsis revealed a conserved taxonomic structure between the duckweed
      microbiome and the terrestrial leaf microbiome. Our results suggest that
      duckweeds utilize similar bacterial community assembly principles as those found 
      in terrestrial plants and indicate a highly conserved structuring effect of leaf 
      tissue on the plant microbiome.

TI  - Oral and Gut Microbial Diversity and Immune Regulation in Patients with HIV on
      Antiretroviral Therapy.

AB  - Despite evidence of a chronic inflammatory phenotype in people living with HIV
      (PLWH) on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the role of oral microbiota in chronic
      immune activation has not been fully explored. We aimed to determine the
      relationship between oral and gut microbiome diversity and chronic systemic
      inflammation in ART-treated PLWH with prevalent severe periodontitis, an
      inflammatory condition commonly associated with HIV infection. We assessed
      bacterial and fungal communities at oral and gastrointestinal sites in a cohort
      (n = 52) of primarily postmenopausal women on ART using 16S rRNA and internal
      transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and measured cellular and soluble markers of 
      inflammation and immune dysfunction. Linear mixed-effect regression and
      differential abundance analyses were used to associate clinical characteristics
      and immunological markers with bacterial and fungal diversity and community
      composition. Bacterial alpha-diversity in plaque, saliva, and gut was associated 
      with different immunological markers, while mycobial diversity was not associated
      with soluble or cellular biomarkers of immune stimulation or T cell dysfunction. 
      Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-positive (LPS(+)) bacteria previously linked to
      inflammatory outcomes were enriched at oral sites in patients with severe
      periodontitis. Fungal alpha-diversity was reduced in plaque from teeth with
      higher clinical attachment loss, a marker of periodontitis, and in saliva and
      plaque from patients with a history of AIDS. Our results show that both bacterial
      and fungal oral microbiome communities likely play a role in chronic systemic
      immune activation in PLWH. Thus, interventions targeting both inflammation and
      the microbiome, particularly in the oral cavity, may be necessary to reduce
      chronic immune dysregulation in patients with HIV.IMPORTANCE A feedback loop
      between dysbiotic gut microbiota, increased translocation of microbial products
      such as lipopolysaccharide, and inflammation has been hypothesized to cause
      immune system dysfunction in early HIV infection. However, despite evidence of a 
      chronic inflammatory phenotype in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART), the
      role of oral microbiota in systemic immune activation and the relationship
      between oral and gut bacterial and fungal diversity have not been explored. Our
      study suggests a crucial role for oral bacterial and fungal communities in
      long-term systemic immune activation in patients on ART, expanding the current
      paradigm focused on gut bacteria. Our results indicate that interventions
      targeting both inflammation and microbial diversity are needed to mitigate oral
      inflammation-related comorbidities, particularly in HIV-positive patients. More
      broadly, these findings can bolster general models of microbiome-mediated chronic
      systemic immune activation and aid the development of precise microbiota-targeted
      interventions to reverse chronic inflammation.

TI  - Community Structure, Diversity and Potential of Endophytic Bacteria in the
      Primitive New Zealand Medicinal Plant Pseudowintera colorata.

AB  - Although the importance of the plant microbiome in commercial plant health has
      been well established, there are limited studies in native medicinal plants.
      Pseudowintera colorata (horopito) is a native New Zealand medicinal plant
      recognized for its antimicrobial properties. Denaturing gradient gel
      electrophoresis (DGGE) and Illumina MiSeq analysis of P. colorata plants from ten
      sites across New Zealand showed that tissue type strongly influenced the
      diversity and richness of endophytic bacteria (PERMANOVA, P < 0.05). In addition,
      two OTUs belonging to the genus Pseudomonas (Greengenes ID: 646549 and 138914)
      were found to be present in >75% of all P. colorata leaf, stem and root samples
      and were identified as the members of the P. colorata "core endomicrobiome".
      Culture-independent analysis was complemented by the recovery of 405 endophytic
      bacteria from the tissues of P. colorata. Some of these cultured endophytic
      bacteria (n = 10) showed high antagonism against four different phytopathogenic
      fungi tested. The influence of endophytic bacteria on plant growth was assessed
      by inoculating P. colorata seedlings. The mean shoot height of seedlings treated 
      with Bacillus sp. TP1LA1B were longer (1.83x), had higher shoot dry weight (1.8x)
      and produced more internodes (1.8x) compared to the control.

TI  - Deciphering the Bifidobacterial Populations within the Canine and Feline Gut
      Microbiota.
LID - e02875-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02875-19 [doi]
AB  - During the course of evolution, dogs and cats have been subjected to extensive
      domestication, becoming the principal companion animals for humans. For this
      reason, their health care, including their intestinal microbiota, is considered
      of considerable importance. However, the canine and feline gut microbiota still
      represent a largely unexplored research area. In the present work, we profiled
      the microbiota of 23 feline fecal samples by 16S rRNA gene and bifidobacterial
      internally transcribed spacer (ITS) approaches and compared this information with
      previously reported data from 138 canine fecal samples. The obtained data allowed
      the reconstruction of the core gut microbiota of the above-mentioned samples
      coupled with their classification into distinct community state types at both
      genus and species levels, identifying Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, and Prevotella 
      9 as the main bacterial components of the canine and feline gut microbiota. At
      the species level, the intestinal bifidobacterial gut communities of dogs and
      cats differed in terms of both species number and composition, as emphasized by a
      covariance analysis. Together, our findings show that the intestinal populations 
      of cats and dogs are similar in terms of genus-level taxonomical composition,
      while at the bifidobacterial species level, clear differences were observed,
      indicative of host-specific colonization behavior by particular bifidobacterial
      taxa.IMPORTANCE Currently, domesticated dogs and cats are the most cherished
      companion animals for humans, and concerns about their health and well-being are 
      therefore important. In this context, the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in 
      maintaining and promoting host health. However, despite the social relevance of
      domesticated dogs and cats, their intestinal microbial communities are still far 
      from being completely understood. In this study, the taxonomical composition of
      canine and feline gut microbiota was explored at genus and bifidobacterial
      species levels, allowing classification of these microbial populations into
      distinct gut community state types at either of the two investigated taxonomic
      levels. Furthermore, the reconstruction of core gut microbiota coupled with
      covariance network analysis based on bifidobacterial internally transcribed
      spacer (ITS) profiling revealed differences in the bifidobacterial compositions
      of canine and feline gut microbiota, suggesting that particular bifidobacterial
      species have developed a selective ability to colonize a specific host.

TI  - Revealing the Variation and Stability of Bacterial Communities in Tomato
      Rhizosphere Microbiota.
LID - E170 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8020170 [doi]
AB  - Microorganisms that colonize the plant rhizosphere can contribute to plant
      health, growth and productivity. Although the importance of the rhizosphere
      microbiome is known, we know little about the underlying mechanisms that drive
      microbiome assembly and composition. In this study, the variation, assembly and
      composition of rhizobacterial communities in 11 tomato cultivars, combined with
      one cultivar in seven different sources of soil and growing substrate, were
      systematically investigated. The tomato rhizosphere microbiota was dominated by
      bacteria from the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria, mainly 
      comprising Rhizobiales, Xanthomonadales, Burkholderiales, Nitrosomonadales,
      Myxococcales, Sphingobacteriales, Cytophagales and Acidobacteria subgroups. The
      bacterial community in the rhizosphere microbiota of the samples in the cultivar 
      experiment mostly overlapped with that of tomato cultivar MG, which was grown in 
      five natural field soils, DM, JX, HQ, QS and XC. The results supported the
      hypothesis that tomato harbors largely conserved communities and compositions of 
      rhizosphere microbiota that remains consistent in different cultivars of tomato
      and even in tomato cultivar grown in five natural field soils. However,
      significant differences in OTU richness (p < 0.0001) and bacterial diversity (p =
      0.0014 < 0.01) were observed among the 7 different sources of soil and growing
      substrate. Two artificial commercial nutrient soils, HF and CF, resulted in a
      distinct tomato rhizosphere microbiota in terms of assembly and core community
      compared with that observed in natural field soils. PERMANOVA of beta diversity
      based on the combined data from the cultivar and soil experiments demonstrated
      that soil (growing substrate) and plant genotype (cultivar) had significant
      impacts on the rhizosphere microbial communities of tomato plants (soil, F =
      22.29, R(2) = 0.7399, p < 0.001; cultivar, F = 2.04, R(2) = 0.3223, p = 0.008).
      Of these two factors, soil explained a larger proportion of the compositional
      variance in the tomato rhizosphere microbiota. The results demonstrated that the 
      assembly process of rhizosphere bacterial communities was collectively influenced
      by soil, including the available bacterial sources and biochemical properties of 
      the rhizosphere soils, and plant genotype.

AB  - Variation among animals in their host-associated microbial communities is
      increasingly recognized as a key determinant of important life history traits
      including growth, metabolism, and resistance to disease. Quantitative estimates
      of the factors shaping the stability of host microbiomes over time at the
      individual level in non-model organisms are scarce. Addressing this gap in our
      knowledge is important, as variation among individuals in microbiome stability
      may represent temporal gain or loss of key microbial species and functions linked
      to host health and/or fitness. Here we use controlled experiments to investigate 
      how both heterogeneity in microbial species richness of the environment and
      exposure to the emerging pathogen Ranavirus influence the structure and temporal 
      dynamics of the skin microbiome in a vertebrate host, the European common frog
      (Rana temporaria). Our evidence suggests that altering the bacterial species
      richness of the environment drives divergent temporal microbiome dynamics of the 
      amphibian skin. Exposure to ranavirus effects changes in skin microbiome
      structure irrespective of total microbial diversity, but individuals with higher 
      pre-exposure skin microbiome diversity appeared to exhibit higher survival.
      Higher diversity skin microbiomes also appear less stable over time compared to
      lower diversity microbiomes, but stability of the 100 most abundant ("core")
      community members was similar irrespective of microbiome richness. Our study
      highlights the importance of extrinsic factors in determining the stability of
      host microbiomes over time, which may in turn have important consequences for the
      stability of host-microbe interactions and microbiome-fitness correlations.

      grass seeds from low moisture and high moisture climates.
PG  - e8417

AB  - Turfgrass investigators have observed that plantings of grass seeds produced in
      moist climates produce seedling stands that show greater stand evenness with
      reduced disease compared to those grown from seeds produced in dry climates.
      Grass seeds carry microbes on their surfaces that become endophytic in seedlings 
      and promote seedling growth. We hypothesize that incomplete development of the
      microbiome associated with the surface of seeds produced in dry climates reduces 
      the performance of seeds. Little is known about the influence of moisture on the 
      structure of this microbial community. We conducted metagenomic analysis of the
      bacterial communities associated with seeds of three turf species (Festuca rubra,
      Lolium arundinacea, and Lolium perenne) from low moisture (LM) and high moisture 
      (HM) climates. The bacterial communities were characterized by Illumina
      high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA V3-V4 regions. We performed seed
      germination tests and analyzed the correlations between the abundance of
      different bacterial groups and seed germination at different taxonomy ranks.
      Climate appeared to structure the bacterial communities associated with seeds. LM
      seeds vectored mainly Proteobacteria (89%). HM seeds vectored a denser and more
      diverse bacterial community that included Proteobacteria (50%) and Bacteroides
      (39%). At the genus level, Pedobacter (20%), Sphingomonas (13%), Massilia (12%), 
      Pantoea (12%) and Pseudomonas (11%) were the major genera in the bacterial
      communities regardless of climate conditions. Massilia, Pantoea and Pseudomonas
      dominated LM seeds, while Pedobacter and Sphingomonas dominated HM seeds. The
      species of turf seeds did not appear to influence bacterial community
      composition. The seeds of the three turf species showed a core microbiome
      consisting of 27 genera from phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Patescibacteria
      and Proteobacteria. Differences in seed-vectored microbes, in terms of diversity 
      and density between high and LM climates, may result from effects of moisture
      level on the colonization of microbes and the development of microbe community on
      seed surface tissues (adherent paleas and lemmas). The greater diversity and
      density of seed vectored microbes in HM climates may benefit seedlings by helping
      them tolerate stress and fight disease organisms, but this dense microbial
      community may also compete with seedlings for nutrients, slowing or modulating
      seed germination and seedling growth.

TI  - Microbial Community Distribution and Core Microbiome in Successive Wound Grades
      of Individuals with Diabetic Foot Ulcers.
LID - e02608-19 [pii]

AB  - Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a major complication of diabetes with high morbidity
      and mortality rates. The pathogenesis of DFUs is governed by a complex milieu of 
      environmental and host factors. The empirical treatment is initially based on
      wound severity since culturing and profiling the antibiotic sensitivity of
      wound-associated microbes is time-consuming. Hence, a thorough and rapid analysis
      of the microbial landscape is a major requirement toward devising evidence-based 
      interventions. Toward this, 122 wound (100 diabetic and 22 nondiabetic) samples
      were sampled for their bacterial community structure using both culture-based and
      next-generation 16S rRNA-based metagenomics approach. Both the approaches showed 
      that the Gram-negative microbes were more abundant in the wound microbiome. The
      core microbiome consisted of bacterial genera, including Alcaligenes,
      Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Corynebacterium in decreasing order of average
      relative abundance. Despite the heterogenous nature and extensive sharing of
      microbes, an inherent community structure was apparent, as revealed by a cluster 
      analysis based on Euclidean distances. Facultative anaerobes (26.5%) were
      predominant in Wagner grade 5, while strict anaerobes were abundant in Wagner
      grade 1 (26%). A nonmetric dimensional scaling analysis could not clearly
      discriminate samples based on HbA1c levels. Sequencing approach revealed the
      presence of major culturable species even in samples with no bacterial growth in 
      culture-based approach. Our study indicates that (i) the composition of core
      microbial community varies with wound severity, (ii) polymicrobial species
      distribution is individual specific, and (iii) antibiotic susceptibility varies
      with individuals. Our study suggests the need to evolve better-personalized care 
      for better wound management therapies.IMPORTANCE Chronic nonhealing diabetic foot
      ulcers (DFUs) are a serious complication of diabetes and are further exacerbated 
      by bacterial colonization. The microbial burden in the wound of each individual
      displays diverse morphological and physiological characteristics with unique
      patterns of host-pathogen interactions, antibiotic resistance, and virulence.
      Treatment involves empirical decisions until definitive results on the causative 
      wound pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibility profiles are available.
      Hence, there is a need for rapid and accurate detection of these polymicrobial
      communities for effective wound management. Deciphering microbial communities
      will aid clinicians to tailor their treatment specifically to the microbes
      prevalent in the DFU at the time of assessment. This may reduce DFUs associated
      morbidity and mortality while impeding the rise of multidrug-resistant microbes.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics of Chironomus transvaalensis populations and the microbial
      community composition of their egg masses.
LID - fnaa008 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnaa008 [doi]
AB  - Chironomids (Diptera; Chironomidae) are the most abundant insects in freshwater
      environments and are considered natural reservoirs of Vibrio cholerae. We
      monitored the annual dynamics of chironomid populations along with their
      microbiota in order to better understand host-microbiota interactions. Chironomus
      transvaalensis populations peaked biannually in August and May-June. The
      composition of the endogenous bacterial communities of their egg masses clustered
      in two groups according to the sampling periods August-November and May-July.
      Nevertheless, a core bacterial community (43%) was present in all egg-mass
      samples. The most abundant phyla were: Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria 
      and Bacteroidetes. The abundance of several genera (e.g. Rheinheimera and
      Pseudomonas) was positively correlated with C. transvaalensis population
      dynamics, while a predator-prey interaction was observed between the relative
      abundance of Vibrio OTUs and C. transvaalensis population size. Chironomids are
      known to tolerate toxic and stress conditions, and our results demonstrated that 
      bacterial genera that may protect the insect under these conditions are present
      in the egg masses. After hatching, the first larval meal is the gelatinous matrix
      that surrounds the eggs. This meal contains a probiotic consortium that may
      protect the larva during its metamorphosis. The results provide important
      insights into the host-microbe interactions of chironomids.

TI  - Changes in Microbiota Across Developmental Stages of Aedes koreicus, an Invasive 
      Mosquito Vector in Europe: Indications for Microbiota-Based Control Strategies.
PG  - 2832
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02832 [doi]
AB  - Since it has been understood that gut microbiota of vector mosquitoes can
      influence their vector competence, efforts have been undertaken to develop new
      control strategies based on host microbiota manipulation, and aimed at
      suppressing the vector population or replacing it with a less competent one. For 
      the proper design of such control strategies it is necessary to know the
      microbiota composition of the target vector species, how it is acquired, and how 
      it changes throughout the host's life cycle. In this study, 16S rRNA amplicon
      high-throughput sequencing was used to characterize the changes in microbiota
      from the aquatic environment (larval breeding sites) to the different
      developmental stages of field-collected Aedes koreicus in Italy, an emerging
      invasive mosquito species in Europe and a potential vector of several pathogens. 
      The bacterial communities of the aquatic breeding sites, larvae, pupae and adults
      showed distinctive structures to one another. Indeed, 84% of community members
      were unique to a given sample type. Nevertheless, almost 40% of the sequences
      generated were assigned to bacteria detected in all sample types, suggesting the 
      importance of bacteria transstadially transmitted from water to the adult stage
      in constituting mosquito microbiota. Among these, genus C39 largely constituted
      water microbiota, family Burkholderiaceae was the most abundant in larvae and
      pupae, and genus Asaia dominated adult communities. In addition, Asaia
      constituted a core microbiota across all sample types. Our results suggest that
      the microbiota of Ae. koreicus mosquitoes is composed by a community which
      derives from the aquatic bacteria of the larval breeding sites, is then filtered 
      by the larval gut, where only certain members are able to persist, rearranged by 
      metamorphosis and finally modified by the change in diet at the adult stage.
      Understanding how the microbiota of Ae. koreicus changes through the mosquito
      life cycle represents a first step in selecting bacterial candidates for use in
      microbiota-based intervention measures for this species. The properties which
      Asaia exhibits in this species, such as dominance, high prevalence and
      transstadial transmission, prevent the use of Wolbachia but make Asaia an ideal
      candidate for paratransgenesis.

TI  - Prenatal Transfer of Gut Bacteria in Rock Pigeon.
LID - E61 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8010061 [doi]
AB  - Vertebrates evolved in concert with bacteria and have developed essential
      mutualistic relationships. Gut bacteria are vital for the postnatal development
      of most organs and the immune and metabolic systems and may likewise play a role 
      during prenatal development. Prenatal transfer of gut bacteria is shown in four
      mammalian species, including humans. For the 92% of the vertebrates that are
      oviparous, prenatal transfer is debated, but it has been demonstrated in domestic
      chicken. We hypothesize that also non-domestic birds can prenatally transmit gut 
      bacteria. We investigated this in medium-sized Rock pigeon (Columba livia),
      ensuring neonates producing fair-sized first faeces. The first faeces of 21
      neonate rock pigeons hatched in an incubator, contained a microbiome (bacterial
      community) the composition of which resembled the cloacal microbiome of females
      sampled from the same population (N = 5) as indicated by multiple shared phyla,
      orders, families, and genera. Neonates and females shared 16.1% of the total
      number of OTUs present (2881), and neonates shared 45.5% of their core microbiome
      with females. In contrast, the five females shared only 0.3% of the 1030 female
      OTUs present. These findings suggest that prenatal gut bacterial transfer may
      occur in birds. Our results support the hypothesis that gut bacteria may be
      important for prenatal development and present a heritability pathway of gut
      bacteria in vertebrates.

LID - 10.1007/s10653-019-00482-5 [doi]
AB  - Operation performance and bacterial community structure of sulfur-based
      autotrophic denitrification (SAD) based on different sulfur sources served as
      electron donor was first parallelly compared among three sequencing batch
      reactors. Sulfur and sodium thiosulfate systems achieved similar operation
      performance and were superior to that of sodium sulfide. When the influent
      NO3(-)-N concentration ranged from 50 to 150 mg/L, the effluent NO3(-)-N
      concentrations of the sulfur and sodium thiosulfate systems were 0-5.99 mg/L and 
      0-4.52 mg/L, respectively, without NO2(-)-N accumulation. However, when the
      effluent concentration of NO3(-)-N in the sodium sulfide system was 0-10.38 mg/L,
      that of NO2(-)-N in the effluent was 0-39.85 mg/L. In addition, participation of 
      sulfur sources presented obvious pressure on the bacterial community structure
      based on the high-throughput sequencing. Microbial diversity results indicated
      that sludge with elemental sulfur as electron donor had the richest microbial
      diversity, followed by sodium thiosulfate and sodium sulfide. Moreover, sludge
      with elemental sulfur and sodium thiosulfate as electron donor demonstrated more 
      similar community structure compared with the sludge that denitrified with sodium
      sulfide according to the microbial similarity analysis. The 9.34%, 24.3% and
      29.6% of sequences could be assigned to potential SAD organisms from sludge
      denitrifying with elemental sulfur, sodium thiosulfate and sodium sulfide,
      respectively. Furthermore, all sludge denitrifying with different sulfur sources 
      showed an enrichment of separate core functional microorganisms. This study could
      provide an insight into improving the understanding of SAD in engineering
      applications.

TI  - Fungal Communities of the Canola Rhizosphere: Keystone Species and Substantial
      Between-Year Variation of the Rhizosphere Microbiome.
PG  - 762-777

AB  - Rhizosphere microbes influence one another, forming extremely complex webs of
      interactions that may determine plant success. Identifying the key factors that
      structure the fungal microbiome of the plant rhizosphere is a necessary step in
      optimizing plant production. In a long-term field experiment conducted at three
      locations in the Canadian prairies, we tested the following hypotheses: (1)
      diversification of cropping systems influences the fungal microbiome of the
      canola (Brassica napus) rhizosphere; (2) the canola rhizosphere has a core fungal
      microbiome, i.e., a set of fungi always associated with canola; and (3) some taxa
      within the rhizosphere microbiome of canola are highly interrelated and fit the
      description of hub taxa. Our results show that crop diversification has a
      significant effect on the structure of the rhizosphere fungal community but not
      on fungal diversity. We also discovered and described a canola core microbiome
      made up of one zero-radius operational taxonomic unit (ZOTU), cf. Olpidium
      brassicae, and an eco-microbiome found only in 2013 consisting of 47 ZOTUs. Using
      network analysis, we identified four hub taxa in 2013: ZOTU14 (Acremonium sp.),
      ZOTU28 (Sordariomycetes sp.), ZOTU45 (Mortierella sp.) and ZOTU179 (cf. Ganoderma
      applanatum), and one hub taxon, ZOTU17 (cf. Mortierella gamsii) in 2016. None of 
      these most interacting taxa belonged to the core microbiome or eco-microbiome for
      each year of sampling. This temporal variability puts into question the idea of a
      plant core fungal microbiome and its stability. Our results provide a basis for
      the development of ecological engineering strategies for the improvement of
      canola production systems in Canada.

AB  - Dark tea is a unique fermented tea produced by solid-state fermentation of tea
      leaves (Camellia sinensis). It includes ripe Pu-erh tea, Fu brick tea, Liupao
      tea, and other teas. Microbial fermentation is considered to be the key factor
      controlling the quality of dark tea. It involves a series of reactions that
      modify the chemical constituents of tea leaves. These chemical conversions during
      microbial fermentation of dark tea are associated with a variety of functional
      core microorganisms. Further, Multi-omics approaches have been used to reveal the
      microbial impact on the conversion of the chemical components in dark tea. In the
      present review, we provide an overview of the most recent advances in the
      knowledge of the microbial bioconversion of the chemical components in dark tea, 
      including the chemical composition of dark tea, microbial community composition
      and dynamics during the fermentation process, and the role of microorganisms in
      biotransformation of chemical constituents.

TI  - Composition and functional diversity of fecal bacterial community of wild boar,
      commercial pig and domestic native pig as revealed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
PG  - 843-857

AB  - The bacterial community in mammalian gastrointestinal tract is abundant and
      complex. To date, little is known about the gut microbiota of wild boar. This
      study aimed to investigate the fecal bacterial diversity of wild boar and compare
      with commercial pig and domestic native pig. The diet composition showed that the
      diets of wild boar, commercial pig and domestic native pig were different from
      each other. More than 1,760,000 quality-filtered sequences were obtained, and the
      results revealed distinct compositions and diversity of fecal microbiota in three
      groups. PCoA and NMDS analyses showed that fecal bacterial communities of wild
      boar, commercial pig and domestic native pig formed distinctly different
      clusters. Although the three groups shared a large size of OTUs comprising a core
      microbiota community, a strong distinction existed at family and genus levels.
      Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae and Christensenellaceae were more abundant in the
      feces of wild boar than in domestic native pig and commercial pig. At the genus
      level, the proportion of unidentified Christensenellaceae was remarkably higher
      in wild boar group, while commercial pig and domestic native pig group had a
      higher abundance of Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. Tax4Fun predictions of
      metagenome function showed statistically significant differences in the functions
      of fecal microbiota in three groups. There were more bacteria genes with amino
      acid metabolism, cell growth and death, cell motility, energy metabolism, immune 
      system and environmental adaptation observed in wild boar feces, while commercial
      pig feces contained more bacteria genes with carbohydrate metabolism, drug
      resistance, aging, infectious diseases, lipid metabolism, endocrine and metabolic
      diseases. These results indicated that the fecal microbial ecosystem of the wild 
      boar is significantly different from that of domestic native pig and commercial
      pig, suggesting that diet is an important factor leading to differences in
      bacterial abundance and diversity in feces.

TI  - Blood Loss Leads to Increase in Relative Abundance of Opportunistic Pathogens in 
      the Gut Microbiome of Rabbits.
PG  - 415-424
LID - 10.1007/s00284-019-01825-2 [doi]
AB  - Massive blood loss, a common pathological complication in the clinic, is often
      accompanied by altered gut integrity and intestinal wall damage. Little is known 
      to what extent the gut microbiome could be correlated with this process. The gut 
      microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, especially in immune and
      inflammatory responses. This study aims to determine whether acute blood loss
      affects the gut microbiome and the dynamic variation of the gut microbiome
      following the loss of blood. We used New Zealand rabbits to mimic the blood loss 
      complication and designed a five-time-point fecal sampling strategy including
      24-h pre-blood loss procedure, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 1-week post-blood loss
      procedure. Gut microbiome composition and diversity were analyzed using 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing and downstream alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and taxonomy
      analysis. The gut microbiome changed dramatically after blood loss procedure.
      There was a significant increase in diversity and richness of the gut microbiome 
      at 24-h post-procedure (P = 0.038). Based on an analysis of similarities, the
      composition of gut microbiome in the samples collected at 24-h post-procedure was
      significantly different from that of pre-procedure samples (r = 0.79, P = 0.004
      weighted unifrac distance; r = 0.99, P = 0.002, unweighted unifrac distance). The
      relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly decreased in the
      post-procedure samples (P = 0.0006), while the relative abundance of
      Clostridiales (P = 0.018) and Bacteroidales (P = 0.015) was significantly
      increased after procedure. We also found the relative abundance of Bacilli,
      Lactobacillus, Myroides, and Prevotella decreased gradually at different time
      points after blood loss. The relative abundance of the Clostridia,
      Alphaproteobacteria, and Sporosarcina increased at 24-h post-procedure and
      decreased thereafter. This preliminary study discovered potential connections
      between blood loss and dysbiosis of gut microbiome. The diversity and abundance
      of the gut microbiome was affected to various extents after acute blood loss and 
      unable to be restored to the original microbiome profile even after one week. The
      increase in relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens after blood loss could 
      be an important indication to reconsider immune and inflammatory responses after 
      acute blood loss from the perspective of gut microbiome.

AB  - As a traditional fermented cereal, Inner Mongolian acidic gruel has a unique
      flavor and rich nutrition, but the microbial diversity of acidic gruel and the
      microbial differences among the products in different regions have not been
      reported. The bacterial diversity and the lactic acid bacteria species of 27
      types of traditional handmade acidic gruel were evaluated using a combination of 
      MiSeq high-throughput sequencing and PCR-DGGE. All 358,205 high-quality 16S rRNA 
      reads were divided into 25,171 OTUs under the similarity of 97%. Firmicutes,
      Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacterial phyla, and the core
      dominant genera were Lactobacillus and Acetobacter with average relative
      abundances of 64.06% and 24.13%, respectively. The primary genera that caused the
      differences in the bacterial community structure between the Bayan Nur and Ordos 
      acidic gruel samples were Pseudomonas, Leuconostoc, and Acinetobacter as revealed
      by redundancy analysis (RDA). PCR-DGGE analyses revealed that the lactic acid
      bacteria in both the Bayan Nur and Ordos samples of acidic gruel were
      Lactobacillus (L.) amylolyticus, L. alimentarius, L. fermentum, L. hamsteri, L.
      helveticus, L. panis, L. plantarum, L. pontis, and Leuconostoc lactis. In
      addition, L. hamsteri was the core strain detected among all the samples. The
      results deepened the understanding of the microbial community composition and the
      diversity of acidic gruel to provide a theoretical basis for the preservation and
      protection of microbial resources in acidic gruel in the Inner Mongolia area.

TI  - Characterization of the core microbiome in tobacco leaves during aging.
PG  - e984
LID - 10.1002/mbo3.984 [doi]
AB  - Microbiome plays an important role during the tobacco aging process which was an 
      indispensable link in the production and processing of cigarettes. However, the
      structure and functions of microbiome have not been clarified during the tobacco 
      aging process. In this study, 16S rDNA and ITS amplicon sequencing techniques
      were used to analyze the core microbiome of 15 tobacco samples from five
      different aging stages. The whole bacterial microbiome was classified into 29
      microbial phyla and 132 orders. Enterobacteriales (63%), Pseudomonadales (16%),
      Sphingomonadales (8%), Xanthomonadales (4%), Burkholderiales (4%), Rhizobiales
      (3%), and Bacillales (2%) comprised the core bacterial microbiome. The whole
      fungal microbiome was classified into five microbial phyla and 52 orders.
      Incertae_sedis_Eurotiomycetes (27%), Wallemiales (25%), Sporidiobolales (17%),
      Capnodiales (5%), Eurotiales (2%), an unclassified Ascomycota (12%), and an
      unidentified Eurotiomycetes (4%) comprised the core fungal microbiome. FAPROTAX
      function prediction suggested that the core microbiome has a substantial
      potential for the carbon cycle, nitrate metabolism, aromatic compound
      degradation, chitinolysis, cellulolysis, and xylanolysis, but simultaneously, the
      core microbiome is also a source of human pathogens. The dynamics of the
      bacterial community were primarily determined by the total nitrogen in tobacco
      leaves during the aging process, while those of the fungal microbiome were
      primarily determined by total organic carbon. This study indicated that the core 
      microbiome activities may play an important role in regulating the loss of carbon
      organic compounds and enhancing the secondary metabolites during tobacco leaves
      aging process.

AB  - Rapid sand biofiltration (RSBF) is widely used for the removal of contaminants
      from drinking water treatment systems. Biofilm microbiomes in the biofilter media
      play essential roles in biotransformation of contaminants, but is not
      comprehensively understood. This study reports on Mn(II) oxidation and the core
      microbiomes in magnetite sand RSBF (MagS-RSBF) and manganese sand RSBF
      (MnS-RSBF). MnS-RSBF showed a relatively higher Mn(II) removal rate (40-91.2%)
      than MagS-RSBF during the start-up. MagS-RSBF and MnS-RSBF had similar Mn(II)
      removal rates (94.13% and 99.16%) over stable operation for 80 days. Mn(II)
      removal rates at different depths in the MnS-RSBF reactor significantly changed
      with operation time, and the filter in the upper layer of MnS-RSBF made the
      largest contribution to Mn(II) oxidation once operation had stabilized. PacBio
      single molecule sequencing of full-length 16S rRNA gene indicated that biofilter 
      medium had a significant impact on the core microbiomes of the biofilms from the 
      two biofilters. The magnetite sand biofilter facilitated the enrichment of
      Mn(II)-oxidizing biofilms. The dominant populations consisted of Pedomicrobium,
      Pseudomonas, and Hyphomicrobium in the RSBF, which have been affiliated with
      putative manganese-oxidizing bacteria (MnOB). The relative abundance of
      Pedomicrobium manganicum increased with operation time in both RSBF reactors. In 
      addition, Nordella oligomobilis and Derxia gummosa were statistically correlated 
      with Mn(II) oxidation. Species-species co-occurrence networks indicated that the 
      microbiome of MnS-RSBF had more complex correlations than that of MagS-RSBF,
      implying that biofilter medium substantially shaped the microbial community in
      the RSBF. Hyphomicrobium and nitrite-oxidizing Nitrospira moscoviensis were
      positively correlated. The core microbiomes' composition of both RSBF reactors
      converged over operation time. A hybrid biofilter medium with magnetite sand and 
      manganese sand may therefore be best in rapid sand filtration for Mn(II)
      oxidation.

TI  - Systematic evaluation of the gut microbiome of swamp eel (Monopterus albus) by
      16S rRNA gene sequencing.
PG  - e8176
LID - 10.7717/peerj.8176 [doi]
AB  - Background: The swamp eel (Monopterus albus) is a commercially important farmed
      species in China. The dysbiosis and homeostasis of gut microbiota has been
      suggested to be associated with the swamp eel's disease pathogenesis and food
      digestion. Although the contributions of gut microbiome in fish growth and health
      has been increasingly recognized, little is known about the microbial community
      in the intestine of the swamp eel (Monopterus albus). Methods: The intestinal
      microbiomes of the five distinct gut sections (midgut content and mucosa, hindgut
      content and mucosa, and stools) of swamp eel were compared using Illumina MiSeq
      sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence and statistical analysis.
      Results: The results showed that the number of observed OTUs in the intestine
      decreased proximally to distally. Principal coordinate analysis revealed
      significant separations among samples from different gut sections. There were 54 
      core OTUs shared by all gut sections and 36 of these core OTUs varied
      significantly in their abundances. Additionally, we discovered 66
      section-specific enriched KEGG pathways. These section-specific enriched
      microbial taxa (e.g., Bacillus, Lactobacillus) and potential function capacities 
      (e.g., amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism) might play vital roles in 
      nutrient metabolism, immune modulation and host-microbe interactions of the swamp
      eel. Conclusions: Our results showed that microbial diversity, composition and
      function capacity varied substantially across different gut sections. The gut
      section-specific enriched core microbial taxa and function capacities may perform
      important roles in swamp eel's nutrient metabolism, immune modulation, and
      host-microbe interactions. This study should provide insights into the gut
      microbiome of the swamp eel.

      basins of tungsten mine.

AB  - In a circular economy concept, where more than 300 million tons of mining and
      quarrying wastes are produced annually, those are valuable resources, supplying
      metals that are extracted today by other processes, if innovative methods and
      processes for efficient extraction of these elements are applied. This work aims 
      to assess microbiological and chemical spatial distribution within two tailing
      basins from a tungsten mine, using a MiSeq approach targeting the 16S rRNA gene, 
      to relate microbial composition and function with chemical variability, thus,
      providing information to enhance the efficiency of the exploitation of these
      secondary sources. The tailings sediments core microbiome comprised members of
      family Anaerolineacea and genera Acinetobacter, Bacillus, Cellulomonas,
      Pseudomonas, Streptococcus and Rothia, despite marked differences in tailings
      physicochemical properties. The higher contents of Al and K shaped the community 
      of Basin 1, while As-S-Fe contents were correlated with the microbiome
      composition of Basin 2. The predicted metabolic functions of the microbiome were 
      rich in genes related to metabolism pathways and environmental information
      processing pathways. An in-depth understanding of the tailings microbiome and its
      metabolic capabilities can provide a direction for the management of tailings
      disposal sites and maximize their potential as secondary resources.

TI  - Gut microbiota structure differs between honeybees in winter and summer.
PG  - 801-814
LID - 10.1038/s41396-019-0568-8 [doi]
AB  - Adult honeybees harbor a specialized gut microbiota of relatively low complexity.
      While seasonal differences in community composition have been reported, previous 
      studies have focused on compositional changes rather than differences in absolute
      bacterial loads. Moreover, little is known about the gut microbiota of winter
      bees, which live much longer than bees during the foraging season, and which are 
      critical for colony survival. We quantified seven core members of the bee gut
      microbiota in a single colony over 2 years and characterized the community
      composition in 14 colonies during summer and winter. Our data show that total
      bacterial loads substantially differ between foragers, nurses, and winter bees.
      Long-lived winter bees had the highest bacterial loads and the lowest community
      alpha-diversity, with a characteristic shift toward high levels of Bartonella and
      Commensalibacter, and a reduction of opportunistic colonizers. Using gnotobiotic 
      bee experiments, we show that diet is a major contributor to the observed
      differences in bacterial loads. Overall, our study reveals that the gut
      microbiota of winter bees is remarkably different from foragers and nurses.
      Considering the importance of winter bees for colony survival, future work should
      focus on the role of the gut microbiota in winter bee health and disease.

TI  - How and Why Men and Women Differ in Their Microbiomes: Medical Ecology and
      Network Analyses of the Microgenderome.
PG  - 1902054
LID - 10.1002/advs.201902054 [doi]
AB  - Microgenderome or sexual dimorphism in microbiome refers to the bidirectional
      interactions between microbiotas, sex hormones, and immune systems, and it is
      highly relevant to disease susceptibility. A critical step in exploring
      microgenderome is to dissect the sex differences in key community ecology
      properties, which has not been systematically analyzed. This study aims at
      filling the gap by reanalyzing the Human Microbiome Project datasets with two
      objectives: (i) dissecting the sex differences in community diversity and their
      intersubject scaling, species composition, core/periphery species, and
      high-salience skeletons (species interactions); (ii) offering mechanistic
      interpretations for (i). Conceptually, the Vellend-Hanson synthesis of community 
      ecology that stipulates selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal as the four
      processes driving community dynamics is followed. Methodologically, seven
      approaches reflecting the state-of-the-art research in medical ecology of human
      microbiomes are harnessed to achieve the objectives. It is postulated that the
      revealed microgenderome characteristics (categorized as seven aspects of
      differences/similarities) exert far reaching influences on disease
      susceptibility, and are primarily due to the sex difference in selection effects 
      (deterministic fitness differences in microbial species and/or species
      interactions with each other or with their hosts), which are, in turn,
      shaped/modulated by host physiology (immunity, hormones, gut-brain
      communications, etc.).

TI  - Functional Genomics of a Symbiotic Community: Shared Traits in the Olive Fruit
      Fly Gut Microbiota.
PG  - 3778-3791
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evz258 [doi]
AB  - The olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae is a major pest of olives worldwide and
      houses a specialized gut microbiota dominated by the obligate symbiont
      "Candidatus Erwinia dacicola." Candidatus Erwinia dacicola is thought to
      supplement dietary nitrogen to the host, with only indirect evidence for this
      hypothesis so far. Here, we sought to investigate the contribution of the
      symbiosis to insect fitness and explore the ecology of the insect gut. For this
      purpose, we examined the composition of bacterial communities associated with
      Cretan olive fruit fly populations, and inspected several genomes and one
      transcriptome assembly. We identified, and reconstructed the genome of, a novel
      component of the gut microbiota, Tatumella sp. TA1, which is stably associated
      with Mediterranean olive fruit fly populations. We also reconstructed a number of
      pathways related to nitrogen assimilation and interactions with the host. The
      results show that, despite variation in taxa composition of the gut microbial
      community, core functions related to the symbiosis are maintained. Functional
      redundancy between different microbial taxa was observed for genes involved in
      urea hydrolysis. The latter is encoded in the obligate symbiont genome by a
      conserved urease operon, likely acquired by horizontal gene transfer, based on
      phylogenetic evidence. A potential underlying mechanism is the action of mobile
      elements, especially abundant in the Ca. E. dacicola genome. This finding, along 
      with the identification, in the studied genomes, of extracellular surface
      structure components that may mediate interactions within the gut community,
      suggest that ongoing and past genetic exchanges between microbes may have shaped 
      the symbiosis.

TI  - Comparative analysis of the vaginal microbiome of pregnant women with either
      Trichomonas vaginalis or Chlamydia trachomatis.
PG  - e0225545
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0225545 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the significance of the human vaginal microbiome for health 
      and disease is increasingly acknowledged, there is paucity of data on the
      differences in the composition of the vaginal microbiome upon infection with
      different sexually transmitted pathogens. METHOD: The composition of the vaginal 
      bacterial community of women with Trichomonas vaginalis (TV, N = 18) was compared
      to that of women with Chlamydia trachomatis (CT, N = 14), and to that of controls
      (N = 21) (women negative for TV, CT and bacterial vaginosis). The vaginal
      bacterial composition was determined using high throughput sequencing with the
      Ion 16S metagenomics kit of the variable regions 2, 4 and 8 of the bacterial 16S 
      ribosomal RNA gene from the vaginal swab DNA extract of the women. QIIME and R
      package "Phyloseq" were used to assess the alpha- and beta-diversity and absolute
      abundance of the 16S rRNA gene per sample in the three groups. Differences in
      taxa at various levels were determined using the independent T-test. RESULTS: A
      total of 545 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified in all the three 
      groups of which 488 occurred in all three groups (core OTUs). Bacterial
      alpha-diversity, by both Simpson's and Shannon's indices, was significantly
      higher, (p = 0.056) and (p = 0.001) respectively, among women with either TV or
      CT than among controls (mean alpha-diversity TV-infected > CT-infected >
      Controls). At the genus level, women infected with TV had a significantly (p <
      0.01) higher abundance of Parvimonas and Prevotella species compared to both
      controls and CT-infected women, whereas women infected with CT had a
      significantly (p < 0.05) higher abundance of Anaerococcus, Collinsella,
      Corynebacterium and Dialister. CONCLUSION: The vaginal microbiomes of TV and
      CT-infected women were markedly different from each other and from women without 
      TV and CT. Future studies should determine whether the altered microbiomes are
      merely markers of disease, or whether they actively contribute to the pathology
      of the two genital infections.

TI  - Gut Microbiomes of the Eastern Oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the Blue Mussel
      (Mytilus edulis): Temporal Variation and the Influence of Marine
      Aggregate-Associated Microbial Communities.
LID - e00730-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSphere.00730-19 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbial community structure was evaluated for two species of bivalve
      molluscs, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the blue mussel (Mytilus
      edulis) collected from Long Island Sound, Connecticut, over the course of a year.
      These bivalves utilize a shared feeding mechanism, which may result in similar
      gut microbial communities. Their particle diet, marine aggregates, and
      surrounding environment, aggregate-free seawater (AFSW), were also collected for 
      comparison. Due to the suspension-feeding activities of bivalves, the potential
      for aggregate- and AFSW-associated microbiota to influence their microbial
      communities may be significant. Both taxonomic and functional diversity of the
      samples were assessed. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing indicated that oysters
      and mussels maintained similar, but not identical, gut microbiomes, with some
      temporal variation. Throughout the year, bivalve species had gut microbial
      community compositions that were more similar to one another than to aggregates. 
      Within a month, bivalves shared on average a quarter of their total operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) with each other and a 10th of their total OTUs with
      aggregates. During months with warm water temperatures, individuals within each
      of the four sample types had similar alpha diversity, but again, temporal
      variation was observed. On a functional level, bivalve gut microbial communities 
      exhibited variation attributed to host species and season. Unlike oysters, mussel
      gut bacterial communities maintained high richness and evenness values throughout
      the year, even when values for the particle diet and AFSW were reduced. Overall, 
      a core gut bivalve microbiome was present, and it was partially influenced by the
      marine aggregate microbial community.IMPORTANCE This work investigates the
      influence that extrinsic factors, diet, and the environment can have on the
      microbiomes of shellfish. Over the course of a year, the gut microbial
      communities of two species of bivalves, oysters and mussels, held under identical
      conditions in coastal marine waters were compared. While the mussels and oysters 
      harbored gut microbial communities with similar composition, on a functional
      level, they exhibited species and temporal variation. These results indicate that
      intrinsic factors influence the bivalve microbiome, resulting in species
      variability, even when environmental conditions, feeding mechanism, and particle 
      diet are constant. Seasonal and multispecies comparisons for bivalve-associated
      microbial communities are rare, and we believe this research represents an
      important contribution. The results presented here advance our understanding of
      the symbiotic interactions between marine invertebrates, the microbial
      communities they harbor, and the environment.

AB  - Despite numerous studies on plant endophytes, little is known about fungal
      communities associated with different aboveground tissues of living trees. We
      used high-throughput sequencing to compare the diversity and community structure 
      of fungi inhabiting leaves, branches and trunks of Alnus incana and Corylus
      avellana growing at three hemiboreal forest sites. Our analysis revealed that
      tree organs are the main determinants of the structure of fungal communities,
      whereas the effects of host species and locality remained secondary and
      negligible, respectively. The structure of fungal communities in trunks was the
      most distinct compared to that in leaves and branches. The foliar fungal
      communities were more similar within than between individual trees, implying that
      certain fungi may grow through parts of the tree crown. The weak effect of
      locality compared to host organs and species identity suggests that the
      structural variation of fungal communities in the aboveground parts of trees
      depends mainly on deterministic factors rather than dispersal limitation.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02699 [doi]
AB  - Marine sponges host dense, diverse, and species-specific microbial communities
      around the globe; however, most of the current knowledge is restricted to species
      from tropical and temperate waters. Only recently, some studies have assessed the
      microbiome of a few Antarctic sponges; however, contrary to low mid-latitude
      sponges, the knowledge about temporal (stability) patterns in the bacterial
      communities of Antarctic sponges is absent. Here, we studied the temporal
      patterns of bacterial communities in the Antarctic sponges Mycale (Oxymycale)
      acerata, Isodictya sp., Hymeniacidon torquata, and Tedania (Tedaniopsis) wellsae 
      that were tagged in situ and monitored during three austral summers over a
      24-month period. By using amplicon sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene we
      found that the microbiome differed between species. In general, bacterial
      communities were dominated by gammaproteobacterial OTUs; however, M. acerata
      showed the most distinct pattern, being dominated by a single betaproteobacterial
      OTU. The analysis at OTU level (defined at 97% sequence similarity) showed a
      highly stable bacterial community through time, despite the abnormal seawater
      temperatures (reaching 3 degrees C) and rates of temperature increase of 0.15
      degrees C day(-1) recorded in austral summer 2017. Sponges were characterized by 
      a small core bacterial community that accounted for a high percentage of the
      abundance. Overall, no consistent changes in core OTU abundance were recorded for
      all studied species, confirming a high temporal stability of the microbiome. In
      addition, predicted functional pathway profiles showed that the most abundant
      pathways among all sponges belonged mostly to metabolism pathway groups (e.g.,
      amino acid, carbohydrate, energy, and nucleotide). The predicted functional
      pathway patterns differed among the four sponge species. However, no clear
      temporal differences were detected supporting what was found in terms of the
      relatively stable composition of the bacterial communities.

LID - 10.3390/nu11123004 [doi]
AB  - Estrogen decline during menopause is associated with altered metabolism, weight
      gain and increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases. The gut microbiota also
      plays a role in the development of cardiometabolic dysfunction and is also
      subject to changes associated with age-related hormone changes. Phytoestrogens
      are plant-based estrogen mimics that have gained popularity as dietary
      supplements for the treatment or prevention of menopause-related symptoms. These 
      compounds have the potential to both modulate and be metabolized by the gut
      microbiota. Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) contain potent phytoestrogen precursors,
      which rely on microbial biotransformation in the gut to estrogenic forms. We
      supplemented ovariectomized (OVX) or sham-operated (SHAM) C57BL/6 mice, with oral
      estradiol (E2), a flavonoid-rich extract from hops, or a placebo carrier oil, to 
      observe effects on adiposity, inflammation, and gut bacteria composition. Hops
      extract (HE) and E2 protected against increased visceral adiposity and liver
      triglyceride accumulation in OVX animals. Surprisingly, we found no evidence of
      OVX having a significant impact on the overall gut bacterial community structure.
      We did find differences in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila, which was
      lower with HE treatment in the SHAM group relative to OVX E2 treatment and to
      placebo in the SHAM group.

AB  - Microbial organisms of the human gut microbiome do not exist in isolation but
      form complex and diverse interactions to maintain health and reduce risk of
      disease development. The organization of the gut microbiome is assumed to be a
      singular assortative network, where interactions between operational taxonomic
      units (OTUs) can readily be clustered into segregated and distinct communities.
      Here, we leverage recent methodological advances in network modeling to assess
      whether communities in the human microbiome exhibit a single network structure or
      whether co-existing mesoscale network architectures are present. We found
      evidence for core-periphery structures in the microbiome, supported by strong,
      assortative community interactions. This complex architecture, coupled with
      previously reported functional roles of OTUs, provides a nuanced understanding of
      how the microbiome simultaneously promotes high microbial diversity and maintains
      functional redundancy.

AB  - No-tillage (NT) is a common soil-conservation management practice with known
      agricultural advantages and drawbacks. However, its short- and long-term effects 
      on the soil microbiome have not been well established. Here, we compared
      conventional (CT), minimal (MT) and NT practices in two agricultural fields in
      the north of Israel over a period of 3 years. Edaphic properties,
      plant-associated pests, weed species abundance and soil microbial community
      structure were assessed to examine the effects of tillage. Tillage significantly 
      altered physical and chemical soil properties, and a significant increase in
      hydrolytic and redox microbial activities was observed in NT soils from both
      sites. Consistent with this, the microbial community structure of NT samples
      diverged significantly over time from those of CT samples. Repetitive tillage and
      even a single tillage event caused significant changes in the relative abundance 
      of microorganisms at taxonomic levels ranging from phylum to OTU. However, no
      significant difference between treatments was found in microbial community
      alpha-diversity or crop yield. Conversely, higher levels of weed diversity and
      some pests number were found in NT samples. Overall, we demonstrate that tillage 
      plays a major role in shaping microbial community structure, and in influencing

TI  - Niche differentiation rather than biogeography shapes the diversity and
      composition of microbiome of Cycas panzhihuaensis.
PG  - 152
LID - 10.1186/s40168-019-0770-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given their adaptation to nutrient-poor and drought environments,
      cycads are vital models for plant-microbiome interaction research because they
      are likely to host an important reservoir of beneficial microbes that may support
      cycad survival. However, a comprehensive understanding of the diversity and
      community composition of microbiome associated with different plant compartments 
      as well as bulk soils of cycad species remains elusive. METHOD: An extensive
      investigation of species diversity and community composition of bacterial and
      fungal microbiome in roots, seeds, unfertilized seeds, ovules, pollens, and soils
      of Cycas panzhihuaensis L. Zhou & S. Y. Yang has been conducted by high-through
      sequencing technology. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical
      cluster analysis (HCA), and heatmap analysis were applied to test the
      niche-specific effect and biogeography factor among different sample types of
      this cycad species. RESULTS: Highly diverse microbiota and significant variation 
      of community structure were found among different compartments of C.
      panzhihuaensis. Soils exhibited a remarkable differentiation of bacterial
      community composition compared to the other five plant organs as revealed by PCA,
      HCA, and heatmap analyses. Different compartments possessed unique core microbial
      taxa with Pseudomonadaceae and Nectriaceae shared among them. According to the
      indicator species analysis, there was almost no differentiation of dominant
      microbiomes with regard to the geography of the host cycad. Two main transmission
      models existed in the C. panzhihuaensis. CONCLUSIONS: Each sample type
      represented a unique niche and hosted a niche-specific core microbial taxa.
      Contrary to previous surveys, biogeography hardly exerted impact on microbial
      community variation in this study. The majority of the cycad-associated microbes 
      were horizontally derived from soils and/or air environments with the rest
      vertically inherited from maternal plants via seeds. This study offers a robust
      knowledge of plant-microbiome interaction across various plant compartments and
      soils and lends guidelines to the investigation of adaptation mechanism of cycads
      in arid and nutrient-poor environments as well as their evolutionary
      conservation.

TI  - Wild specimens of sand fly phlebotomine Lutzomyia evansi, vector of
      leishmaniasis, show high abundance of Methylobacterium and natural carriage of
      Wolbachia and Cardinium types in the midgut microbiome.
PG  - 17746

AB  - Phlebotomine sand flies are remarkable vectors of several etiologic agents
      (virus, bacterial, trypanosomatid Leishmania), posing a heavy health burden for
      human populations mainly located at developing countries. Their intestinal
      microbiota is involved in a wide range of biological and physiological processes,
      and could exclude or facilitate such transmission of pathogens. In this study, we
      investigated the Eubacterial microbiome from digestive tracts of Lu. evansi
      adults structure using 16S rRNA gene sequence amplicon high throughput sequencing
      (Illumina MiSeq) obtained from digestive tracts of Lu. evansi adults. The samples
      were collected at two locations with high incidence of the disease in humans:
      peri-urban and forest ecosystems from the department of Sucre, Colombia. 289,068 
      quality-filtered reads of V4 region of 16S rRNA gene were obtained and clustered 
      into 1,762 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% similarity. Regarding
      eubacterial diversity, 14 bacterial phyla and 2 new candidate phyla were found to
      be consistently associated with the gut microbiome content. Proteobacteria,
      Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes were the most abundant phyla in all the samples and
      the core microbiome was particularly dominated by Methylobacterium genus.
      Methylobacterium species, are known to have mutualistic relationships with some
      plants and are involved in shaping the microbial community in the phyllosphere.
      As a remarkable feature, OTUs classified as Wolbachia spp. were found abundant on
      peri-urban ecosystem samples, in adult male (OTUs n = 776) and unfed female (OTUs
      n = 324). Furthermore, our results provide evidence of OTUs classified as
      Cardinium endosymbiont in relative abundance, notably higher with respect to
      Wolbachia. The variation in insect gut microbiota may be determined by the
      environment as also for the type of feeding. Our findings increase the richness
      of the microbiota associated with Lu. evansi. In this study, OTUs of
      Methylobacterium found in Lu. evansi was higher in engorged females, suggesting
      that there are interactions between microbes from plant sources, blood nutrients 
      and the parasites they transmit during the blood intake.

TI  - Comparison of the gut microbiota of Rana amurensis and Rana dybowskii under
      natural winter fasting conditions.

LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnz241 [doi]
AB  - Rana amurensis and R. dybowskii occupy similar habitats. As temperatures decrease
      with the onset of winter, both species migrate to ponds for hibernation. Our goal
      was to determine whether different species possess different intestinal
      microbiota under natural winter fasting conditions. We used high-throughput
      Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA gene sequences to analyse the diversity of
      intestinal microbes in the two species. The dominant gut bacterial phyla in both 
      species were Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Linear discriminant
      analysis (LDA) effect size revealed significant enrichment of Proteobacteria in
      R. amurensis and Firmicutes in R. dybowskii. There were significant differences
      in the gut microbiota composition between the species. The core operational
      taxonomic unit numbers in R. amurensis and R. dybowskii shared by the two species
      were 106, 100 and 36. This study indicates that the intestinal bacterial
      communities of the two frog species are clearly different. Phylum-level analysis 
      showed that R. amurensis was more abundant in Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia 
      than R. dybowskii was This is the first study of the composition and diversity of
      the gut microbiota of these two species, providing important insights for future 
      research on the gut microbiota and the role of these bacterial communities in
      frogs.

TI  - Division of labor in honey bee gut microbiota for plant polysaccharide digestion.
PG  - 25909-25916
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1916224116 [doi]
AB  - Bees acquire carbohydrates from nectar and lipids; and amino acids from pollen,
      which also contains polysaccharides including cellulose, hemicellulose, and
      pectin. These potential energy sources could be degraded and fermented through
      microbial enzymatic activity, resulting in short chain fatty acids available to
      hosts. However, the contributions of individual microbiota members to
      polysaccharide digestion have remained unclear. Through analysis of bacterial
      isolate genomes and a metagenome of the honey bee gut microbiota, we identify
      that Bifidobacterium and Gilliamella are the principal degraders of hemicellulose
      and pectin. Both Bifidobacterium and Gilliamella show extensive strain-level
      diversity in gene repertoires linked to polysaccharide digestion. Strains from
      honey bees possess more such genes than strains from bumble bees. In
      Bifidobacterium, genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes are colocated within 
      loci devoted to polysaccharide utilization, as in Bacteroides from the human gut.
      Carbohydrate-active enzyme-encoding gene expressions are up-regulated in response
      to particular hemicelluloses both in vitro and in vivo. Metabolomic analyses
      document that bees experimentally colonized by different strains generate
      distinctive gut metabolomic profiles, with enrichment for specific
      monosaccharides, corresponding to predictions from genomic data. The other 3 core
      gut species clusters (Snodgrassella and 2 Lactobacillus clusters) possess few or 
      no genes for polysaccharide digestion. Together, these findings indicate that
      strain composition within individual hosts determines the metabolic capabilities 
      and potentially affects host nutrition. Furthermore, the niche specialization
      revealed by our study may promote overall community stability in the gut
      microbiomes of bees.

AB  - Projected population growth and climate change will make it inevitable to convert
      neglected and marginal land into productive arable land. We investigate the
      influence of agricultural management practices on nutrient stocks and soil
      functions during the conversion of former extensively used grassland to arable
      land. Effects of grassland removal, tillage, intercropping with faba bean (Vicia 
      faba) and its later incorporation were studied with respect to soil properties
      and bacterial community structure. Therefore, composite samples were collected
      with a core sampler from the topsoil (0-20 cm) in (a) the initial grassland, (b) 
      the transitional phase during the vegetation period of V. faba, (c) after
      ploughing the legume in, and (d) untreated controls. In all samples, nitrate-N,
      ammonium-N, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total nitrogen bound (TNb) were
      analyzed and comparisons of the bacterial community structure after 16S-amplicon 
      sequencing were performed to assess soil functions. Mineralization after
      grassland conversion followed by the biological nitrogen fixation of broad beans 
      enhanced the nitrate-N content in bulk soil from 4 to almost 50 mug N g(-)(1)dw. 
      Bacterial community structure on phylum level in bulk soil was dominated by
      Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidetes and
      remained almost stable. However, alpha and beta-diversity analysis revealed a
      change of the bacterial composition at the final state of the conversion. This
      change was primarily driven by increasing abundances of the genera Massilia and
      Lysobacter, both members of the Proteobacteria, after the decay of the leguminous
      plant residues. Furthermore, increasing abundances of the family Gaiellaceae and 
      its genus Gaiella fostered this change and were related to the decreasing carbon 
      to nitrogen ratio. In short, gentle management strategies could replace the input
      of mineral fertilizer with the aim to contribute to future sustainable and
      intensified production even on converted grassland.

AB  - There is a pressing need for longitudinal studies which examine the stability of 
      the sinonasal microbiota. In this study, we investigated bacterial and fungal
      community composition of the sinuses of four healthy individuals every month for 
      one year, then once every three months for an additional year to capture seasonal
      variation. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes and fungal ITS2 revealed
      communities that were mainly dominated by members of Actinobacteria and
      Basidiomycota, respectively. We observed overall shifts in both bacterial and
      fungal community diversity that were attributable to a combination of individual,
      seasonal and annual changes. The results suggest that each of the subjects
      possessed a strong bacterial sinonasal signature, but that fungal communities
      were less subject specific. Differences in fungal and bacterial diversity between
      subjects, and which OTUs may be correlated with seasonal differences, were
      investigated. A small core community that persisted throughout the two year
      sampling period was identified: Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium and
      Staphylococcus, and one type of fungus, Malassezia restricta. It is likely that
      bacterial and fungal airway microbiomes are dynamic and experience natural shifts
      in diversity with time. The underlying reasons for these shifts appear to be a
      combination of changes in environmental climate and host factors.

TI  - Finding a common core microbiota in two Brazilian dairies through culture and DNA
      metabarcoding studies.

AB  - Dairy foods are complex ecosystems composed of microorganisms from different
      origins that can affect flavor and safety of final products. The objective of
      this paper is to assess the in-house microbiota of two Brazilian dairies and to
      discuss the possible implications of the taxa determined for food protection. In 
      total, 27 samples from dairies were cultured in selective (Baird Parker, de Man, 
      Rogosa and Sharpe) and non-selective (Brain Heart Infusion) media, and the
      isolates were identified by Sanger sequencing. Moreover, metagenomic DNA was
      directly extracted from samples and the structure of the bacterial community was 
      determined by massive DNA sequencing followed by bioinformatics analyses. The
      results showed the majority of isolates belonged to the group of lactic acid
      bacteria, but Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcacceae, Bacillaceae,
      Pseudomonadaceae and Moraxellaceae were also detected. From the reads obtained in
      metataxonomics analyses, a heatmap was constructed and the top 20 OTUs
      (operational taxonomic units) were determined. Besides, 12 most prevalent
      bacterial taxa were assigned to the core microbiota of the dairies evaluated,
      which included Thiomonas thermosulfata, Alkalibacillus salilacus, Pseudomonas
      clemancea, Erythrobacter aquimans, Tetragenococcus doogicus, Macrococcus
      brunensis, Pseudomonas ludensis, Streptococcus dentinousetti, Serratia
      entomophila, Vagococcus teuberi, Lactococcus fujiensis and Tolumonas auensis. In 
      conclusion, the results reveal the presence of bacteria that may be related to
      spoilage and also foodborne diseases, in microbial niches that also present rare 
      taxa, highlighting the importance to consider culture-independent results to
      evaluate and improve food safety.

AB  - The role of the gut microbiome in animal health has become increasingly evident. 
      Although the structure of the gut microbiome of A. mellifera is well known,
      little is known about the dynamic change across different developmental stages.
      In this study, we explored the dynamic changes of the gut microbiota of A.
      mellifera at different developmental stages covering the whole life cycle using
      high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The results indicated that the core
      (shared) gut microbiota changes significantly among different developmental
      stages. The diversity of the bacterial community in workers among different ages 
      was significantly different. In addition, by comparing the core gut microbiota
      among different-aged workers, we found that newly emerged workers had fewer core 
      microbiota. Three genera, Gilliamella, Frischella, and Snodgrassella, were
      significantly colonized at 1 day poste mergence (dpe); Lactobacillus,
      Bifidobacterium, Commensalibacter were significantly colonized at 3 dpe and
      significantly reduced with Gilliamella. Lactobacillus kunkeei and Bartonella were
      significantly colonized at 12 dpe and were significantly decreased with
      Lactobacillus helsingborgensis. Commensalibacter and Bifidobacterium were
      significantly decreased at 25 dpe, and Bacteroides, Escherichia-Shigella, and
      Porphyromonadaceae were significantly decreased between 19 and 25 dpe. Our
      results reveal the succession of the gut microbiota of workers from birth to
      senescence, which provides a theoretical basis for further exploring the roles of
      gut microbiota during different developmental stages.

AB  - Root-associated fungi and bacteria play a pivotal role in the plant-soil
      ecosystem by influencing both plant growth and immunity. The aim of this study
      was to unravel the biodiversity of the bacterial and fungal rhizosphere (RS) and 
      rhizoplane (RP) microbiota of Zhukovskij rannij potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)
      cultivar growing in the Alfisol of Tatarstan, Russia. To assess the structure and
      diversity of microbial communities, we employed the 16S rRNA and internal
      transcribed spacer gene library technique. Overall, sequence analysis showed the 
      presence of 3982 bacterial and 188 fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in
      the RP, and 6018 bacterial and 320 fungal OTUs for in the RS. Comparison between 
      microbial community structures in the RS and RP showed significant differences
      between these compartments. Biodiversity was higher in the RS than in the RP.
      Although members of Proteobacteria (RS-59.1 +/- 4.9%; RP-54.5 +/- 9.2%),
      Bacteroidetes (RS-23.19 +/- 10.2%; RP-34.52 +/- 10.4%) and Actinobacteria
      (RS-11.55 +/- 4.9%; RP-7.7 +/- 5.1%) were the three most dominant phyla,
      accounting for 94-98% of all bacterial taxa in both compartments, notable
      variations were observed in the primary dominance of classes and genera in RS and
      RP samples. In addition, our results demonstrated that the potato rhizoplane was 
      significantly enriched with the genera Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter
      and other potentially beneficial bacteria. The fungal community was predominantly
      inhabited by members of the Ascomycota phylum (RS-81.4 +/- 8.1%; RP-81.7 +/-
      5.7%), among which the genera Fusarium (RS-10.34 +/- 3.41%; RP-9.96 +/- 4.79%),
      Monographella (RS-7.66 +/- 4.43%; RP-9.91 +/- 5.87%), Verticillium (RS-4.6 +/-
      1.43%; RP-8.27 +/- 3.63%) and Chaetomium (RS-4.95 +/- 2.07%; RP-8.33 +/- 4.93%)
      were particularly abundant. Interestingly, potato rhizoplane was significantly
      enriched with potentially useful fungal genera, such as Mortierella and
      Metacordiceps. A comparative analysis revealed that the abundance of Fusarium (a 
      cosmopolitan plant pathogen) varied significantly depending on rotation variants,
      indicating a possible control of phytopathogenic fungi via management-induced
      shifts through crop rotational methods. Analysis of the core microbiome of
      bacterial and fungal community structure showed that the formation of bacterial
      microbiota in the rhizosphere and rhizoplane is dependent on the host plant.

AB  - Yak (Bos grunniens), a ruminant, has a complex gastrointestinal microbial
      ecosystem, which is essential for host nutrition and health. However, not much is
      known about gut microbial communities of yak. This study was conducted to
      characterize the gut microbial diversity and composition of small intestinal and 
      cecal contents of yaks through high-throughput sequencing targeting V3-V4
      hypervariable region of 16S rRNA gene. A total of 916,934 high-quality sequences 
      were obtained and 224 core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) shared all samples.
      The result showed that the microbial community in the small intestine was
      different from cecum sample. In all samples, the majority of bacterial phyla were
      Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. A large proportion of anaerobes in 
      the families Peptostreptococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, Flavobacteriaceae,
      Lachnospiraceae, and Succinivibrionaceae were present in the various intestinal
      segments. The relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Bacteroidaceae and
      Muribaculaceae were significantly higher in cecum than in other segments of
      intestines. At the genus level, Bacteroides was the most predominant genus in
      cecum. The results indicated that yak have abundant and diverse gut microbial
      community. In conclusion, this study characterized the profiles of microbial
      communities across intestinal segments and provide better insight into microbial 
      population structure and diversity of yak.

TI  - Metagenomics Reveals Seasonal Functional Adaptation of the Gut Microbiome to Host
      Feeding and Fasting in the Chinese Alligator.

AB  - As a natural hibernator, the Chinese alligator (Alligator sinensis) is an ideal
      and intriguing model to investigate changes in microbial community structure and 
      function caused by hibernation. In this study, we used 16S rRNA profiling and
      metagenomic analysis to compare the composition, diversity, and functional
      capacity in the gut microbiome of hibernating vs. active Chinese alligators. Our 
      results show that gut microbial communities undergo seasonal restructuring in
      response to seasonal cycles of feeding and fasting in the Chinese alligator, but 
      this animal harbors a core gut microbial community primarily dominated by
      Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes across the gut
      regions. During hibernation, there is an increase in the abundance of bacterial
      taxa (e.g., the genus Bacteroides) that can degrade host mucin glycans, which
      allows adaptation to winter fasting. This is accompanied by the enrichment of
      mucin oligosaccharide-degrading enzyme and carbohydrate-active enzyme families.
      In contrast, during the active phase (feeding), active Chinese alligators exhibit
      a carnivore gut microbiome dominated by Fusobacteria, and there is an increase in
      the relative abundance of bacteria (e.g., Cetobacterium somerae) with known
      proteolytic and amino acids-fermentating functions that improve host protein-rich
      food digestion efficiency. In addition, seasonal variations in the expression of 
      beta-defensins play a protective role in intestinal immunity. These findings
      provide insights into the functional adaptations of host-gut microbe symbioses to
      seasonal dietary shifts to maintain gut homeostasis and health, especially in
      extreme physiological states.

AB  - To compare the structure of microbial community in the oily wastewater treatment 
      plants (OWWTPs) located in China, and to discern the impacts of environment
      variables on the variance of microbial community, activated sludge samples from
      six typical OWWTPs were taken and the structure of microbial community of these
      six samples were analyzed via Illumina high-throughput sequencing. 18 core genera
      including Comamonas, Bacillus, Pseudomonas, Thauera, Paenibacillus, etc. were
      shared by all OWWTPs. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) suggested that
      temperature, oil concentration, DO and pH exhibited significant impacts in
      shaping the structure of microbial community. Variance partitioning analyses
      (VPA) illuminated that the most variation in microbial community was contributed 
      to geographic location, explaining 36.4% of the total variations obtained,
      followed by wastewater characteristics (18.7%) and operational parameters (8.6%).
      This work offered insights into the structure of microbial community in OWWTPs at
      different geographic locations and illustrated the correlations between
      environment variables and microbial community in OWWTPs.

TI  - Culture-independent analysis of an endophytic core microbiome in two species of

AB  - The main goal of the study was to determine the structure of endophytic bacteria 
      inhabiting different parts (endosperm, germ, roots, coleoptiles, and leaves) of
      two wheat species, Triticum aestivum L. (cv. 'Hondia') and Triticum spelta L.
      (cv. 'Rokosz'), in order to provide new knowledge about the stability and/or
      changeability of the core microbiome in different plant organs. The endophytic
      core microbiome is associated with plants throughout their whole life cycle;
      however, plant organs can determine the actual endophytic community. Therefore,
      next generation sequencing with MiSeq Illumina technology was applied to identify
      the endophytic microbiome of T. aestivum and T. spelta. Bioinformatic analyses
      were performed with the use of the DADA2(1.8) package and R software (3.5.1). It 
      was demonstrated that wheat, which is an important crop plant, was associated
      with beneficial endophytic bacteria inside the endosperms, germs, roots, leaves, 
      and coleoptiles. Importantly, for the first time, biodiversity was recognized in 
      the coleoptiles of the investigated wheat species. Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas
      and Janthinobacterium were shown to be common genera for both tested wheat
      cultivars. Among them, Pseudomonas was found to be the only endophytic genus
      accompanying both wheat species from the endosperm stage to the development of
      the leaf. Paenibacillus was recognized as a core genus for the 'Hondia' cv.,
      whereas Pedobacter and Duganella constituted the core microbiome in the 'Rokosz' 
      cv. In addition, the first insight into the unique and yet unrecognized
      endophytic microbiome of T. spelta is presented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Scylla paramamosain is a commercially important mud crab. The
      microbiota is a community that inhabits the crab intestine, and is important for 
      physiological functional and host health. RESULTS: Proteobacteria, Firmicutes,
      Bacteroidetes, Tenericutes, Spirochaetae and Fusobacteria were the dominant phyla
      of the 36 representative phyla. Eleven genera of the 820 representative genera
      were considered as core gut microbiota and were distributed in the five dominant 
      phyla. The core genus of the Proteobacteria included Arcobacter, Photobacterium, 
      Vibrio, Shewanella and Desulfovibrio. The other four phyla contained one or two
      genera. Male and female crab samples had two different core genera, (male
      samples: Psychrilyobacter & Lactococcus; female samples:
      Clostridium_sensu_stricto_11 and Candidatus_Bacilloplasma). CONCLUSIONS: This is 
      the first time core intestinal microbiota have been identified in crab from nine 
      coastal regions of southern China. This study provides sequencing data related to
      the gut microbiota of S. paramamosain, and may contribute to probiotic
      development for S. paramamosain aquaculture industries.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Alcohol intake with circadian rhythm disruption (CRD)
      increases colon cancer risk. We hypothesized that eating during or around
      physiologic rest time, a common habit in modern society, causes CRD and
      investigated the mechanisms by which it promotes alcohol-associated colon
      carcinogenesis. METHODS: The effect of feeding time on CRD was assessed using B6 
      mice expressing a fusion protein of PERIOD2 and LUCIFERASE (PER2::LUC) were used 
      to model colon polyposis and to assess the effects of feeding schedules, alcohol 
      consumption, and prebiotic treatment on microbiota composition, short-chain fatty
      acid levels, colon inflammation, and cancer risk. The relationship between
      butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile was assessed by inactivating the
      butyrate receptor GPR109A. RESULTS: Eating at rest (wrong-time eating [WTE])
      shifted the phase of the colon rhythm in PER2::LUC mice. In TS4Cre x APC(lox468) 
      mice, a combination of WTE and alcohol exposure (WTE + alcohol) decreased the
      levels of short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria and of butyrate, reduced
      colonic densities of regulatory T cells, induced a proinflammatory profile
      characterized by hyperpermeability and an increased mucosal T-helper cell
      17/regulatory T cell ratio, and promoted colorectal cancer. Prebiotic treatment
      improved the mucosal inflammatory profile and attenuated inflammation and cancer.
      WTE + alcohol-induced polyposis was associated with increased signal transducer
      and activator of transcription 3 expression. Decreased butyrate signaling
      activated the epithelial signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in
      vitro. The relationship between butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile 
      was confirmed in human colorectal cancers using The Cancer Genome Atlas.
      CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal timing of food intake caused CRD and interacts with alcohol
      consumption to promote colon carcinogenesis by inducing a protumorigenic
      inflammatory profile driven by changes in the colon microbiota and butyrate
      signaling. Accession number of repository for microbiota sequence data: raw FASTQ
      data were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under project PRJNA523141.

AB  - The spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is a growing global problem.
      Activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been proposed as
      a hotspot for ARGs. However, few studies have been conducted to uncover the
      temporal dynamics of the resistome of AS in WWTPs by long-term longitudinal
      sampling. In this study, we quantified ARGs and identified their host microbiome 
      in a Hong Kong WWTP in 97 monthly AS samples spanning 9years. Throughout this
      analysis, we demonstrated that both the abundance and structures of the resistome
      changed significantly every two to three years, implying that there was a
      successive selection of resistomes in the AS system over the study period. The
      detection of genes of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are emerging major
      threats to public health in the AS samples, including mcr, CRE
      (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and MRSA (methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus)-related genes, highlight the role of WWTPs as reservoirs
      of ARGs. In addition, the core resistome (abundant and persistent genes) in AS
      were found to overlap with those in other ecosystems such as urban sewage,
      livestock feces, and fishpond sediments, revealing the broad dissemination of
      ARGs in WWTPs and other environments. Annual variation of resistomes were
      explained via structural equation modeling (SEM), which deciphered the structural
      linkages of determining factors such as the operational parameters, microbial
      community composition and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Specifically,
      potentially relevant antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) were explored and
      discussed based on assembly-based analyses and network correlations. Moreover,
      consistent with the clear relationship between resistomes and mobile genetic
      elements (MGEs), it was found that there was a relatively high potential for gene
      exchange in AS in comparison with soil genomes, which could be explained by the
      engineering features of WWTPs. Based on these findings, longitudinal monitoring
      of WWTPs is warranted for risk assessment to reveal emerging ARGs, resistome
      evolution, correlations with ARBs, and the potential for spread in downstream
      environments and concomitant exposure risks for humans.

AB  - Gut microbiota can affect multiple brain functions and cause behavioral
      alterations through the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In our previous study, we
      found that the absence of gut microbiota can influence the expression of
      microRNAs and mRNAs in the hippocampal region of the germ-free (GF) mice. Long
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly being recognized as an important
      functional transcriptional regulator in the brain. In the present study, we aim
      to identify possible biological pathways and functional networks for
      lncRNA-associated transcript of the gut microbiota in relation to the brain
      function. The profiles of lncRNA and mRNA from specific pathogen-free (SPF),
      colonized GF (CGF), and GF mice were generated using the Agilent Mouse LncRNA
      Array v2.0. Differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs were identified, and 
      lncRNA target genes were also predicted. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was
      performed to analyze related signaling pathways and biological functions
      associated with these dysregulated mRNAs and target genes. Validation with
      quantitative real-time PCR was performed on several key genes. Compared with SPF 
      mice a total of 2230 DE lncRNAs were found in GF mice. Among these, 1355 were
      upregulated and 875 were downregulated. After comparing the target genes of DE
      lncRNAs with mRNA datasets, 669 overlapping genes were identified. IPA core
      analyses revealed that most of these genes were highly associated with cardiac
      hypertrophy, nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT) gonadotropin-releasing
      hormone (GnRH), calcium, and cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)
      signaling pathways. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of APP, CASP9, IGFBP2,
      PTGDS, and TGFBR2 genes that are involved in central nervous system functions
      were significantly changed in the GF mouse hippocampus. Through this study, for
      the first time, we describe the effect of gut microbiota on the hippocampal
      lncRNA regulation. This will help in enhancing the overall knowledge about
      microbiota-gut-brain axis.

TI  - Natural Communities of Carotenogenic Chlorophyte Haematococcus lacustris and
      Bacteria from the White Sea Coastal Rock Ponds.
PG  - 785-800

AB  - Haematococcus lacustris is a biotechnologically important green unicellular alga 
      producing widely used keta-karotenoid astaxanthin. In natural habitats, it exists
      in the form of algal-bacterial community, and under laboratory conditions, it is 
      also accompanied by bacteria. The issue of the bacterial composition of
      industrial algal cultures is widely recognized as important. However, there is a 
      dearth of information about bacterial composition of H. lacustris communities. In
      current work, we analyze the composition of natural H. lacustris communities from
      the White Sea coastal temporal rock ponds. For the first time, a 16S rRNA
      gene-based metagenome of natural H. lacustris bacterial communities has been
      generated. Main results of its analysis are as follow. Bacterial families
      Comamonadaceae, Cytophagaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Acetobacteraceae,
      Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodocyclaceae were observed in all studied H. lacustris
      natural communities. They also contained genera Hydrogenophaga and Cytophaga.
      Bacteria from the Hydrogenophaga genus were present in H. lacustris cultures
      after their isolation under the conditions of laboratory cultivation. Similar to 
      other planktonic microalgae, H. lacustris forms a phycosphere around the cells.
      In this zone, bacteria attached to the algal surface. The contact between H.
      lacustris and bacteria is maintained even after sample drying. The study provides
      information about possible members of H. lacustris core microbiome, which can be 
      presented in the industrial and laboratory cultures of the microalga.

TI  - Diet is not the primary driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of
      litter-feeding cockroaches.
PG  - 238
LID - 10.1186/s12866-019-1601-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diet is a major determinant of bacterial community structure in
      termite guts, but evidence of its importance in the closely related cockroaches
      is conflicting. Here, we investigated the ecological drivers of the bacterial gut
      microbiota in cockroaches that feed on lignocellulosic leaf litter. RESULTS: The 
      physicochemical conditions determined with microsensors in the guts of Ergaula
      capucina, Pycnoscelus surinamensis, and Byrsotria rothi were similar to those
      reported for both wood-feeding and omnivorous cockroaches. All gut compartments
      were anoxic at the center and showed a slightly acidic to neutral pH and variable
      but slightly reducing conditions. Hydrogen accumulated only in the crop of B.
      rothi. High-throughput amplicon sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes documented
      that community structure in individual gut compartments correlated strongly with 
      the respective microenvironmental conditions. A comparison of the hindgut
      microbiota of cockroaches and termites from different feeding groups revealed
      that the vast majority of the core taxa in cockroaches with a lignocellulosic
      diet were present also in omnivorous cockroaches but absent in wood-feeding
      higher termites. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that diet is not the primary
      driver of bacterial community structure in the gut of wood- and litter-feeding
      cockroaches. The high similarity to the gut microbiota of omnivorous cockroaches 
      suggests that the dietary components that are actually digested do not differ
      fundamentally between feeding groups.

TI  - Identification of Metagenomics Structure and Function Associated With Temporal
      Changes in Rat (Rattus norvegicus) Skin Microbiome During Health and Cutaneous
      Burn.
PG  - 347-358
LID - 10.1093/jbcr/irz165 [doi]
AB  - The cutaneous skin microbiome is host to a vast ensemble of resident microbes
      that provide essential capabilities including protection of skin barrier
      integrity and modulation of the host immune response. Cutaneous burn-injury
      promotes alteration of cutaneous and systemic immune response that can affect
      both commensal and pathogenic microbes. A cross-sectional study of a limited
      number of burn patients revealed a difference in the bacteriome of burned versus 
      control participants. Temporal changes of the skin microbiome during health and
      cutaneous burn-injury remains largely unknown. Furthermore, how this microbial
      shift relates to community function in the collective metagenome remain elusive. 
      Due to cost considerations and reduced healing time, rodents are frequently used 
      in burn research, despite inherent physiological differences between rodents and 
      human skin. Using a rat burn model, a longitudinal study was conducted to
      characterize the rat skin bacterial residents and associated community functions 
      in states of health (n = 30) (sham-burned) and when compromised by burn-injury (n
      = 24). To address the knowledge gap, traumatic thermal injury and disruption of
      cutaneous surface is associated with genus-level changes in the microbiota,
      reduced bacterial richness, and altered representation of bacterial genes and
      associated predicted functions across different skin microbial communities. These
      findings demonstrate that, upon burn-injury, there is a shift in diversity of the
      skin's organismal assemblages, yielding a core microbiome that is distinct at the
      genome and functional level. Moreover, deviations from the core community
      correlate with temporal changes post-injury and community transition from the
      state of cutaneous health to disease (burn-injury).

TI  - Variation in the microbial community contributes to the improvement of the main
      active compounds of Magnolia officinalis Rehd. et Wils in the process of
      sweating.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1186/s13020-019-0267-4 [doi]
AB  - Background: Magnolia officinalis Rehd. et Wils, commonly called Houpo, has been
      used for thousands of years in China as a traditional herbal medicine. The
      primary processing of Houpo requires sweating treatment, which is a special
      drying process and is considered to be an essential embodiment of high quality
      and genuine medicinal materials. The sweating of Houpo leads to peculiar changes 
      in the microbial community structure and the content of main active substances
      (magnolol, honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine). Variation in the microbial
      community was considered the cause of the change in content of active substances 
      of Houpo, although the microbial taxa responsible for the improvement of content 
      remain unidentified. Methods: In this study, we used MiSeq high-throughput
      sequencing methods for partial bacterial 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA gene sequences to 
      compare the bacterial and fungal community structures at different timepoints in 
      the process of sweating. The content of the main active substances (magnolol,
      honokiol, syringin and magnoflorine) were determined by high-performance liquid
      chromatography analysis to evaluate the effects of sweating. UPLC-Q-Extractive
      Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UPLC-QE Orbitrap MS) was used to detection of
      differential metabolites of unsweated Houpo before and after co-culture with core
      bacterial solutions. Results: In this study, the total contents of magnolol (MG) 
      and honokiol (HK) were significantly increased at 4 dp (dp for day PM sample), up
      to 3.75%, and the contents of syringin (SG) and magnoflorine (MF) were as high as
      0.12% and 0.06%, respectively. Bacterial abundance and diversity were higher in
      the early stage (0 day-2 da; da for day AM sample) than in the later stage (4-5
      dp), while fungal abundance was more obvious in the later stage than in the early
      stage. Positive correlation coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of 
      Enterobacter (P < 0.05), Klebsiella (P < 0.05), Weissella (P < 0.05), Bacillus (P
      < 0.05) and Candida (P < 0.05) would be conducive to improving the quality of
      Houpo. Negative correlation coefficients revealed that the relative abundance of 
      Actinomycetospora, Singulisphaera, Mucilaginibacter, Deinococcus, Gemmatirosa,
      Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, Hymenobacter, Halomonas and Capnobotryella could 
      be a potential antagonist for the decrease in the quality of Houpo. After
      co-culture of single core strain and unsweated Houpo, there was no significant
      difference in the four main active components, but there were other metabolites
      with significant difference. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that sweating
      increased the content of the main active compounds, promoted the relative
      abundance of potentially beneficial microbes, decreased the abundance of
      potentially harmful microbes, the core functional genera group together, forming 
      a core microbiome, these genera are dominant across the different stages of the
      sweating process and contribute to the quality development of the characteristics
      of Houpo. Meanwhile, this study presented a clear scope for potential beneficial 
      microbes that improve the quality of Houpo.

      organisms. In this study, we investigated 795 time-resolved metagenomes from
      tropical air, generating 2.27 terabases of data. Despite only 9 to 17% of the
      generated sequence data currently being assignable to taxa, the air harbored a
      microbial diversity that rivals the complexity of other planetary ecosystems. The
      airborne microbial organisms followed a clear diel cycle, possibly driven by
      environmental factors. Interday taxonomic diversity exceeded day-to-day and
      month-to-month variation. Environmental time series revealed the existence of a
      large core of microbial taxa that remained invariable over 13 mo, thereby
      underlining the long-term robustness of the airborne community structure. Unlike 
      terrestrial or aquatic environments, where prokaryotes are prevalent, the
      tropical airborne biomass was dominated by DNA from eukaryotic phyla. Specific
      fungal and bacterial species were strongly correlated with temperature, humidity,
      and CO2 concentration, making them suitable biomarkers for studying the
      bioaerosol dynamics of the atmosphere.

AB  - Microbial metabolites, including B complex vitamins contribute to diverse aspects
      of human health. Folate, or vitamin B9, refers to a broad category of
      biomolecules that include pterin, para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), and glutamate
      subunits. Folates are required for DNA synthesis and epigenetic regulation. In
      addition to dietary nutrients, the gut microbiota has been recognized as a source
      of B complex vitamins, including folate. This study evaluated the predicted
      folate synthesis capabilities in the genomes of human commensal microbes
      identified in the Human Microbiome Project and folate production by
      representative strains of six human intestinal bacterial phyla. Bacterial folate 
      synthesis genes were ubiquitous across 512 gastrointestinal reference genomes
      with 13% of the genomes containing all genes required for complete de novo folate
      synthesis. An additional 39% of the genomes had the genetic capacity to
      synthesize folates in the presence of pABA, an upstream intermediate that can be 
      obtained through diet or from other intestinal microbes. Bacterial folate
      synthesis was assessed during exponential and stationary phase growth through the
      evaluation of expression of select folate synthesis genes, quantification of
      total folate production, and analysis of folate polyglutamylation. Increased
      expression of key folate synthesis genes was apparent in exponential phase, and
      increased folate polyglutamylation occurred during late stationary phase. Of the 
      folate producers, we focused on the commensal Lactobacillus reuteri to examine
      host-microbe interactions in relation to folate and examined folate receptors in 
      the physiologically relevant human enteroid model. RNAseq data revealed
      segment-specific folate receptor distribution. Treatment of human colonoid
      monolayers with conditioned media (CM) from wild-type L. reuteri did not
      influence the expression of key folate transporters proton-coupled folate
      transporter (PCFT) or reduced folate carrier (RFC). However, CM from L. reuteri
      containing a site-specific inactivation of the folC gene, which prevents the
      bacteria from synthesizing a polyglutamate tail on folate, significantly
      upregulated RFC expression. No effects were observed using L. reuteri with a site
      inactivation of folC2, which results in no folate production. This work sheds
      light on the contributions of microbial folate to overall folate status and
      mammalian host metabolism.

AB  - Introduction: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted
      pathogen with significant reproductive health implications. Data are mounting
      that the bacterial communities that reside within the vagina, collectively termed
      the vaginal microbiota, aid in defense against sexually transmitted infections.
      Disruptions in the vaginal microbiota, such as during episodes of bacterial
      vaginosis, may increase susceptibility to infection. Herein, we describe the
      clinical core protocol for a NIH NIAID Cooperative Research Center titled
      Eco-Pathogenomic of Chlamydial Reproductive Tract Infection. The primary goals of
      the project are to describe the interrelationships between the urogenital
      microenvironment, the properties of the pathogen and immunologic responses of the
      host in men and women, and their association with clinical outcomes of CT
      infection in women. Methods: Men and women with confirmed genital CT infections
      were recruited to a number of study protocols, including cross-sectional and
      longitudinal sub-studies. Participants completed a demographic and sexual health 
      questionnaire and underwent a physical exam at baseline. In the longitudinal
      study arms, biologic samples were collected daily, weekly, and monthly to
      determine the relationships between the vaginal microbiota, prevalent CT
      infection, re-infection and treatment. Discussion: The biological samples and the
      demographic and history information collected throughout this study will be used 
      for various analyses evaluating genomics, metabolomics and host immune responses 
      in the context of CT infection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Flavonoids are reported to modulate the composition of gut
      microbiota, which play an important role in preventing obesity and associated
      metabolic diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of Total Flavonoids
      of Quzhou Fructus Aurantii Extract (TFQ) on gut microbial community in mice fed
      with a high-fat diet (HFD). METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were fed with either a chow
      diet or HFD with or without oral gavage of TFQ (300 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks.
      RESULTS: Our data indicate TFQ significantly reduced obesity, inflammatio,n and
      liver steatosis. TFQ elevates the expression of tight junction proteins and
      reduces metabolic endotoxemia. In addition, TFQ treatment reverses HFD-induced
      gut dysbiosis, as indicated by the reduction of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes
      ratio, the increase of genera Akkermansia and Alistipes, and the decrease of
      genera Dubosiella, Faecalibaculum, and Lactobacillus. CONCLUSION: These findings 
      support a prebiotic role of TFQ as a dietary supplement for the intervention of
      gut dysbiosis and obesity-related metabolic disorders.

      same region but have vastly different diets. In this study, we used 16S rRNA
      high-throughput sequencing to identify the healthy core microbiome in the gut of 
      wild and captive Pere David's deer and investigate how dietary factors influence 
      the gut microbiome by comparing their differences. A core shared gut microbiome
      was identified in healthy Pere David's deer, which was similar to that of other
      ruminants, mainly comprising the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. There were
      no differences in the richness or diversity of the gut microbiome between the
      wild and captive deer. However, PCA and ANOSIM demonstrated clear differences in 
      the microbial community structure between the captive and wild deer, which mainly
      manifested as changes in the relative abundance of 39 bacterial genera. As the
      majority of these genera were not dominant in the deer gut, no significant
      difference was detected in functional modules related to the microbiome between
      the two groups. Therefore, the difference in dietary factors does not appear to
      affect the healthy core gut microbiome between captive and wild Pere David's
      deer, suggesting strong co-evolution and the possibility of re-establishment in
      the wild. These data could guide future applications of population management in 
      Pere David's deer conservation.

TI  - Rapid Bacterial Community Changes during Vermicomposting of Grape Marc Derived
      from Red Winemaking.

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms7100473 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies dealing with changes in microbial communities during
      vermicomposting were mostly performed at lab-scale conditions and by using
      low-throughput techniques. Therefore, we sought to characterize the bacterial
      succession during the vermicomposting of grape marc over a period of 91 days in a
      pilot-scale vermireactor. Samples were taken at the initiation of
      vermicomposting, and days 14, 28, 42, and 91, representing both active and mature
      stages of vermicomposting. By using 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing,
      significant changes in the bacterial community composition of grape marc were
      found after 14 days and throughout the process (p < 0.0001). There was also an
      increase in bacterial diversity, both taxonomic and phylogenetic, from day 14
      until the end of the trial. We found the main core microbiome comprised of twelve
      bacterial taxa (~16.25% of the total sequences) known to be capable of nitrogen
      fixation and to confer plant-disease suppression. Accordingly, functional
      diversity included increases in specific genes related to nitrogen fixation and
      synthesis of plant hormones (salicylic acid) after 91 days. Together, the
      findings support the use of grape marc vermicompost for sustainable practices in 
      the wine industry by disposing of this high-volume winery by-product and
      capturing its value to improve soil fertility.

      Species.
PG  - 2181
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.02181 [doi]
AB  - Panicum represents a large genus of many North American prairie grass species.
      These include switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), a biofuel crop candidate with wide 
      geographic range, as well as Panicum hallii, a close relative to switchgrass,
      which serves as a model system for the study of Panicum genetics due to its
      diploid genome and short growth cycles. For the advancement of switchgrass as a
      biofuel crop, it is essential to understand host microbiome interactions, which
      can be impacted by plant genetics and environmental factors inducing
      ecotype-specific phenotypic traits. We here compared rhizosphere and root
      endosphere bacterial communities of upland and lowland P. virgatum and P. hallii 
      genotypes planted at two sites in Texas. Our analysis shows that sampling site
      predominantly contributed to bacterial community variance in the rhizosphere,
      however, impacted root endosphere bacterial communities much less. Instead we
      observed a relatively large core endophytic microbiome dominated by ubiquitously 
      root-colonizing bacterial genera Streptomyces, Pseudomonas, and Bradyrhizobium.
      Endosphere communities displayed comparable diversity and conserved community
      structures across genotypes of both Panicum species. Functional insights into
      interactions between P. hallii and its root endophyte microbiome could hence
      inform testable hypotheses that are relevant for the improvement of switchgrass
      as a biofuel crop.

TI  - Wheat-associated microbiota and their correlation with stripe rust reaction.
PG  - 544-555
LID - 10.1111/jam.14486 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study was aimed at revealing the composition of microbiota in leaves, 
      roots and rhizosphere soil of wheat plants that are resistant or susceptible to
      stripe rust, one of the most widely destructive leaf diseases in wheat
      production. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 36 wheat plants that showed resistant
      or susceptible reactions to stripe rust were sampled. Three compartments of each 
      plant including leaves, roots and rhizosphere soil were used for whole-genomic
      DNA extraction and the DNA samples were subjected to high-throughput 16S rRNA
      gene sequencing. A total of 2885 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were revealed
      from the sequencing, and they mainly distributed in the phylum of Proteobacteria.
      Twenty-nine OTUs formed the core microbiota of wheat plants. The differences
      between above- and below-ground environments could explain most of the
      dissimilarity of wheat-associated microbial communities. Therefore, those
      microbes that were able to adapt to the above-ground (leaf) environment might be 
      more important resources for biocontrol agents against stripe rust, and they
      could be from genera Hymenobacter, Flavobacterium, Chitinophage, Flavisolibacter,
      Niastella, Mucilaginibacter, Pedobacter, Aquincola, Massilia, Citrobacter,
      Cronobacter, Ewingella, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas. No matter the microbial
      taxa were significantly selected by the resistant or susceptible wheat plants,
      they contained the members with plant growth promoting (PGP) features and could
      be used as potential biocontrol agents to reduce stripe rust damage. CONCLUSIONS:
      The core microbiota associated with wheat plants and microbial taxa that were
      significantly correlated with reactions to stripe rust were identified in this
      study. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Few studies had been done on the
      microbiota associated with wheat so far. Our study will not only provide
      fundamental knowledge about the composition of wheat-associated microbiota but
      also reveal the microbial taxa that have the potential to be integrated into the 
      strategy of stripe rust management.

TI  - Microbiota characterization of sheep milk and its association with somatic cell
      count using 16s rRNA gene sequencing.
PG  - 73-83
LID - 10.1111/jbg.12446 [doi]
AB  - This work aimed to use 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing with the Illumina MiSeq
      platform to describe the milk microbiota from 50 healthy Assaf ewes. The global
      observed microbial community for clinically healthy milk samples analysed was
      complex and showed a vast diversity. The core microbiota of the sheep milk
      includes five genera: Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium,
      Streptococcus and Escherichia/Shigella. Although there are some differences, some
      of these genera are common with the microbiota core pattern of milk from other
      species, especially with dairy cows. The microbial composition of the studied
      samples, based on the definition of amplicon sequence variants, was analysed
      through a correlation network. A preliminary analysis by grouping the milk
      samples based on their somatic cell count (SCC), which is considered an indicator
      of subclinical mastitis (SM), showed certain differences for the core of the
      samples identified as SM. The differences in the microbiota diversity pattern
      among samples might also suggest that subclinical mastitis would be associated
      with the significant increase in some genera that are inhabitants of the mammary 
      gland and a remarkable concomitant reduction in the microbial diversity.
      Additionally, we have also presented here a preliminary analysis to assess the
      impact of the sheep milk microbiome on SCC, as an indicator of subclinical
      mastitis. The results here reported provide a first characterization of the sheep
      milk microbiota and settle the basis for future studies in this field.

TI  - Exploring the accuracy of amplicon-based internal transcribed spacer markers for 
      a fungal community.
PG  - 170-184
LID - 10.1111/1755-0998.13097 [doi]
AB  - With the continual improvement in high-throughput sequencing technology and
      constant updates to fungal reference databases, the use of amplicon-based DNA
      markers as a tool to reveal fungal diversity and composition in various
      ecosystems has become feasible. However, both primer selection and the
      experimental procedure require meticulous verification. Here, we computationally 
      and experimentally evaluated the accuracy and specificity of three widely used or
      newly designed internal transcribed spacer (ITS) primer sets (ITS1F/ITS2,
      gITS7/ITS4 and 5.8S-Fun/ITS4-Fun). In silico evaluation revealed that primer
      coverage varied at different taxonomic levels due to differences in degeneracy
      and the location of primer sets. Using even and staggered mock community
      standards, we identified different proportions of chimeric and mismatch reads
      generated by different primer sets, as well as great variation in species
      abundances, suggesting that primer selection would affect the results of
      amplicon-based metabarcoding studies. Choosing proofreading and high-fidelity
      polymerase (KAPA HiFi) could significantly reduce the percentage of chimeric and 
      mismatch sequences, further reducing inflation of operational taxonomic units.
      Moreover, for two types of environmental fungal communities, plant endophytic and
      soil fungi, it was demonstrated that the three primer sets could not reach a
      consensus on fungal community composition or diversity, and that primer
      selection, not experimental treatment, determines observed soil fungal community 
      diversity and composition. Future DNA marker surveys should pay greater attention
      to potential primer effects and improve the experimental scheme to increase
      credibility and accuracy.

AB  - Traditional taxonomy in biology assumes that life is organized in a simple tree. 
      Attempts to classify microorganisms in this way in the genomics era led
      microbiologists to look for finite sets of 'core' genes that uniquely group taxa 
      as clades in the tree. However, the diversity revealed by large-scale whole
      genome sequencing is calling into question the long-held model of a hierarchical 
      tree of life, which leads to questioning of the definition of a species.
      Large-scale studies of microbial genome diversity reveal that the cumulative
      number of new genes discovered increases with the number of genomes studied as a 
      power law and subsequently leads to the lack of evidence for a unique core genome
      within closely related organisms. Sampling 'enough' new genomes leads to the
      discovery of a replacement or alternative to any gene. This power law behaviour
      points to an underlying self-organizing critical process that may be guided by
      mutation and niche selection. Microbes in any particular niche exist within a
      local web of organism interdependence known as the microbiome. The same mechanism
      that underpins the macro-ecological scaling first observed by MacArthur and
      Wilson also applies to microbial communities. Recent metagenomic studies of a
      food microbiome demonstrate the diverse distribution of community members, but
      also genotypes for a single species within a more complex community.
      Collectively, these results suggest that traditional taxonomic classification of 
      bacteria could be replaced with a quasispecies model. This model is commonly
      accepted in virology and better describes the diversity and dynamic exchange of
      genes that also hold true for bacteria. This model will enable microbiologists to
      conduct population-scale studies to describe microbial behaviour, as opposed to a
      single isolate as a representative.

AB  - The composition and diversity of the human vaginal microbial community have been 
      investigated intensively due to the diversity-stability relationship (DSR)-based 
      hypothesis for bacterial vaginosis (BV) etiology, which was first proposed in the
      1990s and has received renewed interest in recent years. Nevertheless, diversity 
      changes (scaling) across individuals in a cohort or population have not yet been 
      addressed, which is significant both theoretically and practically.
      Theoretically, biodiversity scaling is the core of biogeography, and practically,
      inter-subject heterogeneity is critical for understanding the etiology and
      epidemiology of human microbiome-associated diseases such as BV. Here we applied 
      the diversity-area relationship (DAR), a recent extension to the classic
      species-area relationship (SAR), to study diversity scaling of the vaginal
      microbiome by reanalyzing reported data collected from 1 107 postpartum women.
      The model used here characterized the power-law (or its extension) relationships 
      between accrued diversity and areas (numbers of individuals), upon which four
      biogeographic profiles were thus defined. Specifically, we established the DAR
      profile (relationship between diversity scaling parameter and so-termed diversity
      order (q)), similarly pair-wise diversity overlap (PDO) profile, maximal accrual 
      diversity (MAD) profile, and ratio of individual-level to population-level
      diversity (RIP) profile. These four profiles offer valuable tools to assess and
      predict diversity scaling (changes) in the human vaginal microbiome across
      individuals, as well as to understand the dynamics of vaginal microbiomes in
      healthy women.

AB  - Gut microbiota communities in mosquitoes are influenced among others, by
      developmental stage. There is evidence that the aquatic environment where larvae 
      feed influences the mosquito gut bacterial community composition with only a
      subgroup of these bacteria been transmitted trans-stadially to adults. This study
      evaluated the gut bacterial composition of Anopheles albimanus larvae, emerged
      and circulating mosquitoes, as well as water from the larval habitat, to
      elucidate transitions in these bacterial communities and determine the final
      composition in circulating mosquitoes. A 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing allowed to 
      determine that Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum in larvae (72.4%),
      emerged mosquitoes (75%), circulating adults (45.4%) and water from the larval
      habitat (79.1%). A core microbiome analysis evidenced that Enterobacter, Bacillus
      and Staphylococcus genera were the core bacterial microbiota (OTUs detected in
      >90%) in the four groups evaluated. PCoA cluster based on Jaccard and Bray Curtis
      distances showed two main bacterial clusters, one comprising the emerged and
      circulating adults, and the other the larvae. The results indicated that the gut 
      microbiota of An. albimanus larvae is composed of bacteria acquired from the
      larval habitat; then, a rearrangement of the bacterial communities occurs in the 
      trans-stadial passage. However, the higher bacterial richness detected in
      circulating adults suggests bacterial acquisition from the terrestrial
      environment where the mosquito feeds. Finally, the trans-stadially passage of
      some bacteria makes of interest their evaluation as candidates for paratransgenic
      control.

AB  - Microbial communities play a central role in the N cycle of oceanic oxygen
      minimum zones (OMZs), such as in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP). We
      explored the spatial distribution of the genetic potential for ammonia oxidation 
      (amoA gene for bacteria and archaea), denitrification (nirS and nirK), anaerobic 
      ammonium oxidation (anammox) (hzo) and dissimilarity nitrate reduction to ammonia
      (DNRA) (nrfA) and their relationships with the hydrological variables and
      isotopic composition of nitrate in the ETNP off Mexico. Oxygen concentration, the
      availability of N chemical forms and the upwelling shaped the distribution of N
      cycling genes along the water column. The high abundance of N genes and the
      isotopic composition of nitrate suggest the N cycling is very dynamic in the OMZ 
      core. The accumulation of nitrite, the high abundance of archaeal amoA genes, and
      the deviation of the N and O isotopes of nitrate from the expected 1:1 ratio for 
      nitrate reduction in the upper portion of this OMZ indicate that nitrification is
      a relevant process that fuels the denitrifier community. Conversely, the high
      abundances of nitrate, ammonium and nrfA genes in the deeper layer indicate that 
      DNRA is a crucial process enhancing anammox there. These results show the need
      for more detailed studies of the N processes in OMZs.

TI  - Using Mothur to Determine Bacterial Community Composition and Structure in 16S
      Ribosomal RNA Datasets.
PG  - e83

AB  - The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene is one of the scaffolding molecules of the
      prokaryotic ribosome. Because this gene is slow to evolve and has very well
      conserved regions, this gene is used to reconstruct phylogenies in prokaryotes.
      Universal primers can be used to amplify the gene in prokaryotes including
      bacteria and archaea. To determine the microbial composition in microbial
      communities using high-throughput short-read sequencing techniques, primers are
      designed to span two or three of the nine variable regions of the gene. Mothur,

AB  - An analysis of sludge (i.e., 63 samples) and biofilm (i.e., 79 samples) sampled
      from 13 anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBR) was conducted. Predominant
      microbial community identification and multivariate analysis indicate that these 
      reactors showed different microbial community structure, but these differences
      had no impact on the overall AnMBR performance. Instead, core microbial genera
      which occurred in >/=90% of sludge (20 genera) and biofilm (12 genera) samples
      could potentially account for the AnMBR performance. A further calculation on net
      growth rate (NGR) of core genera in sludge suggested distribution into two main
      groups (i.e., I: low relative abundance and NGR, II: high relative abundance or
      high NGR). Consistent positive correlations between bacterial genera were
      observed among those that exhibited either high relative abundance or high NGR.
      The anaerobic microbial consortium in both sludge and biofilm were largely
      affected by stochastic dispersal and migration processes (i.e., neutral
      assembly). However, Acinetobacter spp. and Methanobacterium spp. occurred
      consistently in higher frequency in the biofilm but in lower occurrence frequency
      in the AnMBR permeate. Findings from this study suggest first, specific core
      microorganisms exist in the sludge regardless of the operating conditions of the 
      AnMBRs, and second, prevention of biofoulant layer on anaerobic membranes can be 
      devised by minimizing attachment of microbes on surfaces in a non-selective
      manner.

AB  - Sponge diversity has been reported to decrease from well-preserved to polluted
      environments, but whether diversity and intra-species variation of their
      associated microbiomes also change as function of environmental quality remains
      unknown. Our study aimed to assess whether microbiome composition and structure
      are related to the proliferation of some sponges and not others under degraded
      conditions. We characterized the most frequent sponges and their associated
      bacteria in two close areas (impacted and well-preserved) of Nha Trang Bay
      (Indo-Pacific). Sponge assemblages were richer and more diverse in the
      well-preserved reefs, but more abundant (individuals/m. transect) in the impacted
      environments, where two species (Clathria reinwardti and Amphimedon paraviridis) 
      dominated. Sponge microbiomes from the polluted zones had, in general, lower
      bacterial diversity and core size and consequently, higher intra-species
      dispersion than microbiomes of sponges from the well-preserved environments.
      Microbial communities reflect the reduction of diversity and richness shown by
      their host sponges. In this sense, sponges with less complex and more variable
      microbiomes proliferate under degraded environmental conditions, following the
      ecological paradigm that negatively correlates community diversity and
      environmental degradation. Thereby, the diversity and structure of sponge
      microbiomes might indirectly determine the presence and proliferation of sponge
      species in certain habitats.

AB  - The gut microbiota of amphibians is affected by exogenous and endogenous factors.
      We performed a comprehensive analysis using high-throughput sequencing technology
      and functional predictions and observed general changes in the gut microbiota of 
      frogs in different growth stages, seasons, and growth environments. There were no
      significant differences in microbial richness and diversity between juvenile and 
      adult wild frogs, between the summer and autumn groups of captive frogs, or
      between wild and captive frogs. There were significant differences in the gut
      microbiota community structure of Rana dybowskii between the summer and autumn
      groups of captive frogs and between wild and captive R. dybowskii, whereas the
      differences between juvenile and adult wild frogs were not significant. The
      dominant gut bacterial phyla in frogs from both captive and wild environments
      included Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Linear
      discriminant effect size (LEfSe) analysis showed that Bacteroidetes and
      Firmicutes were significantly enriched in captive and wild R. dybowskii,
      respectively linear discriminant analysis (LDA > 4). The core operational
      taxonomical units (OTUs) that were found in >90% of all frogs tested encompassed 
      15 core OTUs. The captive frogs exhibited 15 core OTUs in addition to the above
      overall core microbiota, whereas the wild frogs exhibited 19 core OTUs in
      addition to the above overall core microbiota. Predictions made using
      Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States 
      (PICRUSt) suggested that eleven KEGG pathways, such as infectious diseases,
      immune system diseases, metabolism, metabolism of other amino acids, metabolism
      of cofactors and vitamins, metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides,
      neurodegenerative diseases, and transport and catabolism, were enriched in
      captive frogs. The relative abundance of several red-leg-syndrome-related
      pathogens increased significantly in captive frogs compared with that in wild
      frogs. To our knowledge, this is the first study on the effects of individual
      seasons and captivity on the gut microbiota of frogs.

TI  - Prokaryotic Diversity in Mangrove Sediments across Southeastern China
      Fundamentally Differs from That in Other Biomes.
LID - e00442-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00442-19 [doi]
AB  - Mangroves, as a blue carbon reservoir, provide an environment for a variety of
      microorganisms. Mangroves lie in special locations connecting coastal and
      estuarine areas and experience fluctuating conditions, which are expected to
      intensify with climate change, creating a need to better understand the relative 
      roles of stochastic and deterministic processes in shaping microbial community
      assembly. Here, a study of microbial communities inhabiting mangrove sediments
      across southeastern China, spanning mangroves in six nature reserves, was
      conducted. We performed high-throughput DNA sequencing of these samples and
      compared them with data of 1,370 sediment samples collected from the Earth
      Microbiome Project (EMP) to compare the microbial diversity of mangroves with
      that of other biomes. Our results showed that prokaryotic alpha diversity in
      mangroves was significantly higher than that in other biomes and that microbial
      beta diversity generally clustered according to biome types. The core operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) in mangroves were mostly assigned to Gammaproteobacteria, 
      Deltaproteobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Euryarchaeota The majority of beta
      nearest-taxon index values were higher than 2, indicating that community assembly
      in mangroves was better explained through a deterministic process than through a 
      stochastic process. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and total organic carbon
      (TOC) were main deterministic factors explaining variation in the microbial
      community. This study fills a gap in addressing the unique microbial diversity of
      mangrove ecosystems and their microbial community assembly mechanisms.IMPORTANCE 
      Understanding the underlying mechanisms of microbial community assembly patterns 
      is a vital issue in microbial ecology. Mangroves, as an important and special
      ecosystem, provide a unique environment for examining the relative importance of 
      stochastic and deterministic processes. We made the first global-scale comparison
      and found that microbial diversity was significantly different in mangrove
      sediments compared to that of other biomes. Furthermore, our results suggest that
      a deterministic process is more important in shaping microbial community assembly
      in mangroves.

TI  - Developmental stages and gut microenvironments influence gut microbiota dynamics

PG  - 4343-4359
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14797 [doi]
AB  - Popillia japonica Newman (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) is a highly polyphagous
      invasive beetle originating from Japan. This insect is highly resilient and able 
      to rapidly adapt to new vegetation. Insect-associated microorganisms can play
      important roles in insect physiology, helping their hosts to adapt to changing
      conditions and potentially contributing to an insect's invasive potential. Such
      symbiotic bacteria can be part of a core microbiota that is stably transmitted
      throughout the host's life cycle or selectively recruited from the environment at
      each developmental stage. The aim of this study was to investigate the origin,
      stability and turnover of the bacterial communities associated with an invasive
      population of P. japonica from Italy. Our results demonstrate that soil microbes 
      represent an important source of gut bacteria for P. japonica larvae, but as the 
      insect develops, its gut microbiota richness and diversity decreased
      substantially, paralleled by changes in community composition. Notably, only
      16.75% of the soil bacteria present in larvae are maintained until the adult
      stage. We further identified the micro-environments of different gut sections as 
      an important factor shaping microbiota composition in this species, likely due to
      differences in pH, oxygen availability and redox potential. In addition, P.
      japonica also harboured a stable bacterial community across all developmental
      stages, consisting of taxa well known for the degradation of plant material,
      namely the families Ruminococcacae, Christensenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae.
      Interestingly, the family Christensenallaceae had so far been observed
      exclusively in humans. However, the Christensenellaceae operational taxonomic
      units found in P. japonica belong to different taxonomic clades within this
      family.

TI  - Natural diets promote retention of the native gut microbiota in captive rodents.
PG  - 67-78
LID - 10.1038/s41396-019-0497-6 [doi]
AB  - Wild animals entering captivity experience radical lifestyle changes resulting in
      microbiome alterations. However, little is known about the factors that drive
      microbial community shifts in captivity, and what actions could mitigate
      microbial changes. Using white-throated woodrats (Neotoma albigula), we tested
      whether offering natural diets in captivity facilitates retention of native
      microbial communities of captive animals. Wild-caught woodrats were brought to
      laboratory conditions. Woodrats received either a natural diet of Opuntia cactus 
      or an artificial diet of commercial chow over three weeks. Microbial inventories 
      from woodrat feces at the time of capture and in captivity were generated using
      Illumina 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that providing woodrats with wild-natural 
      diets significantly mitigated alterations in their microbiota, promoting a 90%
      retention of native microbial communities across the experiment. In contrast, the
      artificial diet significantly impacted microbial structure to the extent that 38%
      of the natural microflora was lost. Core bacteria including Bifidobacterium and
      Allobaculum were lost, and abundances of microbes related to oxalate degradation 
      decreased in individuals fed artificial but not natural diets. These results
      highlight the importance of supplementing captive diets with natural foods to
      maintain native microbiomes of animals kept in artificial conditions for
      scientific or conservation purposes.

TI  - Predictors of Obesity among Gut Microbiota Biomarkers in African American Men
      with and without Diabetes.
LID - E320 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms7090320 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbiota and their biomarkers may be associated with obesity. This study
      evaluated associations of body mass index (BMI) with circulating microbiota
      biomarkers in African American men (AAM) (n = 75). The main outcomes included
      fecal microbial community structure (16S rRNA), gut permeability biomarkers
      (ELISA), and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs, metabolome analysis). These outcomes
      were compared between obese and non-obese men, after adjusting for age. The
      results showed that lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), the ratio of LBP to
      CD14 (LBP/CD14), and SCFAs (propionic, butyric, isovaleric) were higher in obese 
      (n = 41, age 58 years, BMI 36 kg/m(2)) versus non-obese (n = 34, age 55 years,
      BMI 26 kg/m(2)) men. BMI correlated positively with LBP, LBP/CD14 (p < 0.05 for
      both) and SCFAs (propionic, butyric, isovaleric, p < 0.01 for all). In the
      regression analysis, LBP, LBP/CD14, propionic and butyric acids were independent 
      determinants of BMI. The study showed for the first time that selected microbiota
      biomarkers (LBP, LBP/CD14, propionic and butyric acids) together with several
      other relevant risks explained 39%-47% of BMI variability, emphasizing that
      factors other than microbiota-related biomarkers could be important. Further
      research is needed to provide clinical and mechanistic insight into microbiota
      biomarkers and their utility for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

      Native Grass Bioenergy Feedstocks.
PG  - 1018
LID - 10.3389/fpls.2019.01018 [doi]
AB  - Plants may actively cultivate microorganisms in their roots and rhizosphere that 
      enhance their nutrition. To develop cropping strategies that substitute mineral
      fertilizers for beneficial root symbioses, we must first understand how microbial
      communities associated with plant roots differ among plant taxa and how they
      respond to fertilization. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and rhizobacteria are
      of particular interest because they enhance nutrient availability to plants and
      perform a suite of nutrient cycling functions. The purpose of this experiment is 
      to examine the root and soil microbiome in a long-term switchgrass (Panicum
      virgatum) biofuel feedstock experiment and determine how AM fungi and
      rhizobacteria respond to plant diversity and soil fertility. We hypothesize that 
      intra- and interspecific plant diversity, nitrogen fertilization (+N), and their 
      interaction will influence the biomass and community composition of AM fungi and 
      rhizobacteria. We further hypothesize that +N will reduce the abundance of
      nitrogenase-encoding nifH genes on the rhizoplane. Roots and soils were sampled
      from three switchgrass cultivars (Cave-in-Rock, Kanlow, Southlow) grown in
      monoculture, intraspecific mixture, and interspecific planting mixtures with
      either Andropogon gerardii or diverse native tallgrass prairie species. Molecular
      sequencing was performed on root and soil samples, fatty acid extractions were
      assessed to determine microbial biomass, and quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction (qPCR) was performed on nifH genes from the rhizoplane. Sequence data
      determined core AM fungal and bacterial microbiomes and indicator taxa for plant 
      diversity and +N treatments. We found that plant diversity and +N influenced AM
      fungal biomass and community structure. Across all plant diversity treatments, +N
      reduced the biomass of AM fungi and nifH gene abundance by more than 40%. The AM 
      fungal genus Scutellospora was an indicator for +N, with relative abundance
      significantly greater under +N and in monoculture treatments. Community
      composition of rhizobacteria was influenced by plant diversity but not by +N.
      Verrucomicrobia and Proteobacteria were the dominant bacterial phyla in both
      roots and soils. Our findings provide evidence that soil fertility and plant
      diversity structure the root and soil microbiome. Optimization of soil
      communities for switchgrass production must take into account differences among
      cultivars and their unique responses to shifts in soil fertility.

AB  - Urban green spaces are closely related to the activities and health of urban
      residents. Turf grass and soil are two major interfaces between the environmental
      and human microbiome, which represent potential pathways for the spread of
      antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from environmental to human microbiome through
      skin-surface contact. However, the information regarding the prevalence of ARGs
      in urban green spaces and drivers in shaping their distribution patterns remain
      unclear. Here, we profiled a wide spectrum of ARGs in grass phyllosphere and
      soils from 40 urban parks across Greater Melbourne, Australia, using high
      throughput quantitative PCR. A total of 217 and 218 unique ARGs and MGEs were
      detected in grass phyllosphere and soils, respectively, conferring resistance to 
      almost all major classes of antibiotics commonly used in human and animals. The
      plant microbiome contained a core resistome, which occupied >84% of the total
      abundance of ARGs. In contrast, no core resistome was identified in the soil
      microbiome. The difference between plant and soil resistome composition was
      attributed to the difference in bacterial community structure and intensity of
      environmental and anthropogenic influence. Most importantly, the abundance of
      ARGs in urban green spaces was significantly positively related to industrial
      factors including total number of business, number of manufacturing, and number
      of electricity, gas, water and waste services in the region. Structural equation 
      models further revealed that industrial distribution was a major factor shaping
      the ARG profiles in urban green spaces after accounting for multiple drivers.
      These findings have important implications for mitigation of the potential risks 
      posed by ARGs to urban residents.

AB  - Frequent and persistent heavy metal pollution has profound effects on the
      composition and activity of microbial communities. Heavy metals select for metal 
      resistance but can also co-select for resistance to antibiotics, which is a
      global health concern. We here document metal concentration, metal resistance and
      antibiotic resistance along a sediment archive from a pond in the North West of
      the United Kingdom covering over a century of anthropogenic pollution. We
      specifically focus on zinc, as it is a ubiquitous and toxic metal contaminant
      known to co-select for antibiotic resistance, to assess the impact of temporal
      variation in heavy metal pollution on microbial community diversity and to
      quantify the selection effects of differential heavy metal exposure on antibiotic
      resistance. Zinc concentration and bioavailability was found to vary over the
      core, likely reflecting increased industrialisation around the middle of the 20th
      century. Zinc concentration had a significant effect on bacterial community
      composition, as revealed by a positive correlation between the level of zinc
      tolerance in culturable bacteria and zinc concentration. The proportion of zinc
      resistant isolates was also positively correlated with resistance to three
      clinically relevant antibiotics (oxacillin, cefotaxime and trimethoprim). The
      abundance of the class 1 integron-integrase gene, intI1, marker for anthropogenic
      pollutants correlated with the prevalence of zinc- and cefotaxime resistance but 
      not with oxacillin and trimethoprim resistance. Our microbial palaeontology
      approach reveals that metal-contaminated sediments from depths that pre-date the 
      use of antibiotics were enriched in antibiotic resistant bacteria, demonstrating 
      the pervasive effects of metal-antibiotic co-selection in the environment.

TI  - Cadmium and Selenate Exposure Affects the Honey Bee Microbiome and Metabolome,
      and Bee-Associated Bacteria Show Potential for Bioaccumulation.

AB  - Honey bees are important insect pollinators used heavily in agriculture and can
      be found in diverse environments. Bees may encounter toxicants such as cadmium
      and selenate by foraging on plants growing in contaminated areas, which can
      result in negative health effects. Honey bees are known to have a simple and
      consistent microbiome that conveys many benefits to the host, and toxicant
      exposure may impact this symbiotic microbial community. We used 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing to assay the effects that sublethal cadmium and selenate treatments
      had over 7 days and found that both treatments significantly but subtly altered
      the composition of the bee microbiome. Next, we exposed bees to cadmium and
      selenate and then used untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)
      metabolomics to show that chemical exposure changed the bees' metabolite profiles
      and that compounds which may be involved in detoxification, proteolysis, and
      lipolysis were more abundant in treatments. Finally, we exposed several strains
      of bee-associated bacteria in liquid culture and found that each strain removed
      cadmium from its medium but that only Lactobacillus Firm-5 microbes assimilated
      selenate, indicating the possibility that these microbes may reduce the metal and
      metalloid burden on their host. Overall, our report shows that metal and
      metalloid exposure can affect the honey bee microbiome and metabolome and that
      strains of bee-associated bacteria can bioaccumulate these toxicants.IMPORTANCE
      Bees are important insect pollinators that may encounter environmental pollution 
      when foraging upon plants grown in contaminated areas. Despite the pervasiveness 
      of pollution, little is known about the effects of these toxicants on honey bee
      metabolism and their symbiotic microbiomes. Here, we investigated the impact of
      selenate and cadmium exposure on the gut microbiome and metabolome of honey bees.
      We found that exposure to these chemicals subtly altered the overall composition 
      of the bees' microbiome and metabolome and that exposure to toxicants may
      negatively impact both host and microbe. As the microbiome of animals can reduce 
      mortality upon metal or metalloid challenge, we grew bee-associated bacteria in
      media spiked with selenate or cadmium. We show that some bacteria can remove
      these toxicants from their media in vitro and suggest that bacteria may reduce
      metal burden in their hosts.

      Pathogen Ecology Along the Farm-To-Fork Continuum.

AB  - While conventionally grown poultry continues to dominate the U. S. poultry
      industry, there is an increasing demand for locally-grown, "all natural"
      alternatives. The use of next generation sequencing allows for not only the gross
      (e.g., community structure) but also fine-scale (e.g., taxa abundances)
      examination of these complex microbial communities. This data provides a better
      understanding of how a pasture flock's microbiome changes throughout the
      production life cycle and how that change in microbial ecology changes foodborne 
      pathogens in alternative poultry production systems. In order to understand this 
      ecology better, pooled broiler samples were taken during the entire flock life
      cycle, from pre-hatch gastrointestinal samples (N = 12) to fecal samples from the
      brood (N = 5), and pasture (N = 10) periods. Additional samples were taken during
      processing, including skin and feather rinsates (N = 12), ceca (N = 12), and
      whole carcass rinses (N = 12), and finally whole carcasss rinsates of final
      products (N = 3). Genomic DNA was extracted, 16S rDNA microbiome sequencing was
      conducted (Illumina MiSeq), and microbiomes were analyzed and compared using
      QIIME 1.9.1 to determine how microbiomes shifted throughout production continuum,
      as well as what environmental factors may be influencing these shifts.
      Significant microbiome shifts occurred during the life cycle of the pasture
      broiler flock, with the brood and pasture fecal samples and cecal samples being
      very distinct from the other pre-hatch, processing, and final product samples.
      Throughout these varied microbiomes, there was a stable core microbiome
      containing 13 taxa. Within this core microbiome, five taxa represented known
      foodborne pathogens (Salmonella, Campylobacter) or potential/emerging pathogens
      (Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Acinetobacter) whose relative abundances varied
      throughout the farm-to-fork continuum, although all were more prevalent in the
      fecal samples. Additionally, of the 25 physiochemical and nutrient variables
      measured from the fecal samples, the carbon to nitrogen ratio was one of the most
      significant variables to warrant further investigations because it impacted both 
      general fecal microbial ecology and Campylobacter and Enterococcus taxa within
      the core fecal microbiomes. These findings demonstrate the need for further
      longitudinal, farm-to-fork studies to understand the ecology of the microbial
      ecology of pasture production flocks to improve animal, environmental, and public
      health.

LID - fiz128 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiz128 [doi]
AB  - The considerable microbial diversity of soils and key role in biogeochemical
      cycling have led to growing interest in their global distribution and the impact 
      that environmental change might have at the regional level. In the broadest study
      of Arctic soil bacterial communities to date, we used high-throughput DNA
      sequencing to investigate the bacterial diversity from 200 independent Arctic
      soil samples from 43 sites. We quantified the impact of spatial and environmental
      factors on bacterial community structure using variation partitioning analysis,
      illustrating a nonrandom distribution across the region. pH was confirmed as the 
      key environmental driver structuring Arctic soil bacterial communities, while
      total organic carbon (TOC), moisture and conductivity were shown to have little
      effect. Specialist taxa were more abundant in acidic and alkaline soils while
      generalist taxa were more abundant in acidoneutral soils. Of the 48 147 bacterial
      taxa, a core microbiome composed of only 13 taxa that were ubiquitously
      distributed and present within 95% of samples was identified, illustrating the
      high potential for endemism in the region. Overall, our results demonstrate the
      importance of spatial and edaphic factors on the structure of Arctic soil
      bacterial communities.

      Selection of Disturbance-tolerant Fungi along an Elevation Gradient.
PG  - 327-333
LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME19073 [doi]
AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi play a significant role in the establishment
      and resilience of vegetation in harsh environments, such as volcanic slopes, in
      which soil is frequently disturbed by ash falling and erosion. We characterized
      AM fungal communities associated with a pioneer grass in a volcanic slope based
      on the disturbance tolerance of the fungi, addressing the hypothesis that soil
      disturbance is a major ecological filter for AM fungi in volcanic ecosystems and,
      thus, fungi that are more tolerant to soil disturbance are selected at higher
      elevations (i.e. nearer to the crater). Paired soil-core samples were collected
      from the rhizosphere of Miscanthus sinensis between the vegetation limit and
      forest limit on a volcanic slope and used in a trap culture with M. sinensis
      seedlings, in which one of the paired samples was sieved to destroy hyphal
      networks (disturbance treatment), while the other was not (intact treatment).
      Seedlings were grown in a greenhouse for two months, and the roots were subjected
      to molecular analysis of fungal communities. AM fungal diversity decreased with
      increasing elevations, in which nested structure was observed. Community
      dissimilarity between the disturbed and intact communities decreased with
      increasing elevations, suggesting that communities at higher elevations were more
      robust against soil disturbance. These results suggest that AM fungi that are
      more tolerant to soil disturbance are more widely distributed across the
      ecosystem, that is, they are generalists. The wide distribution of
      disturbance-tolerant fungi may have significant implications for the rapid
      resilience of vegetation after disturbance in the ecosystem.

TI  - Alteration of Gut Microbiota in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): Cause or
      Consequence? IBD Treatment Targeting the Gut Microbiome.
LID - E126 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens8030126 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic complex inflammatory gut
      pathological condition, examples of which include Crohn's disease (CD) and
      ulcerative colitis (UC), which is associated with significant morbidity. Although
      the etiology of IBD is unknown, gut microbiota alteration (dysbiosis) is
      considered a novel factor involved in the pathogenesis of IBD. The gut microbiota
      acts as a metabolic organ and contributes to human health by performing various
      physiological functions; deviation in the gut flora composition is involved in
      various disease pathologies, including IBD. This review aims to summarize the
      current knowledge of gut microbiota alteration in IBD and how this contributes to
      intestinal inflammation, as well as explore the potential role of gut
      microbiota-based treatment approaches for the prevention and treatment of IBD.
      The current literature has clearly demonstrated a perturbation of the gut
      microbiota in IBD patients and mice colitis models, but a clear causal link of
      cause and effect has not yet been presented. In addition, gut microbiota-based
      therapeutic approaches have also shown good evidence of their effects in the
      amelioration of colitis in animal models (mice) and IBD patients, which indicates
      that gut flora might be a new promising therapeutic target for the treatment of
      IBD. However, insufficient data and confusing results from previous studies have 
      led to a failure to define a core microbiome associated with IBD and the hidden
      mechanism of pathogenesis, which suggests that well-designed randomized control
      trials and mouse models are required for further research. In addition, a better 
      understanding of this ecosystem will also determine the role of prebiotics and
      probiotics as therapeutic agents in the management of IBD.

AB  - Microorganisms provide many physiological functions to herbivorous hosts. Spider 
      mites (genus Tetranychus) are important agricultural pests throughout the world; 
      however, the composition of the spider mite microbial community, especially gut
      microbiome, remains unclear. Here, we investigated the bacterial community in
      five spider mite species and their associated feces by deep sequencing of the 16S
      rRNA gene. The composition of the bacterial community was significantly different
      among the five prevalent spider mite species, and some bacterial symbionts showed
      host-species specificity. Moreover, the abundance of the bacterial community in
      spider mite feces was significantly higher than that in the corresponding spider 
      mite samples. However, Flavobacterium was detected in all samples, and represent 
      a "core microbiome". Remarkably, the maternally inherited endosymbiont Wolbachia 
      was detected in both spider mite and feces. Overall, these results offer insight 
      into the complex community of symbionts in spider mites, and give a new direction
      for future studies.

TI  - Response of gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes to hypoglycemic agents.
PG  - 485-493
LID - 10.1007/s12020-019-02041-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Accumulated evidence has indicated that the gut microbiome affected the 
      pharmacology of anti-diabetic agents, and their metabolic products induced by the
      agents transformed the structure of gastrointestinal microbiota in return.
      However, the studies around heredity, ethnicity, or living condition, referring
      to human microbiome were mostly represented by an occidental pattern partial and 
      rare studies that focused on the effect of several first-line hypoglycemic agents
      on the gut flora in a single medical center. Therefore, we aimed to explore the
      interaction between gut microbiome and type 2 diabetes (T2D) or hypoglycemics in 
      Chinese population. METHODS: A total of 130 T2D patients with a specific
      hypoglycemic treatment and 50 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. Gut
      microbiome compositons were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene-based sequencing
      protocol. RESULTS: Hypoglycemic agents contributed to the alteration of specific 
      species in gut bacteria rather than its total diversity. Metformin increased the 
      abundance of Spirochaete, Turicibacter, and Fusobacterium. Insulin also increased
      Fusobacterium, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (alpha-GIs) contributed to the
      plentitude of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Both metformin and insulin
      improved taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, and alpha-GI promoted several amino 
      acid pathways. Although the community of gut microbiota with metformin and
      insulin showed similarity, significant differences were available in each
      diabetic group with hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: Gut microbiota is significantly
      associated with anti-diabetic agents. The gut microbiome and metabolism have
      shown respective characteristics in different T2D groups, which were also
      significantly different from the healthy group. This study provides some new
      insights for identification and exploration of the pathogenesis of T2D.

AB  - While environmental drivers regulate the structure of mangrove microbial
      communities, their exact nature and the extent of their influence require further
      elucidation. By means of 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing, we determined the
      microbial taxonomic profiles of mangroves in the subtropical Paranagua Bay,
      Brazil, considering as potential drivers: salinity, as represented by two sectors
      in the extremes of a salinity gradient (<5 PSU and >30 PSU); proximity to/absence
      of the prevailing plants, Avicennia schaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa,
      Rhizophora mangle, and Spartina alterniflora; and the chemical composition of the
      sediments. Salinity levels within the estuary had the strongest influence on
      microbial structure, and pH was important to separate two communities within the 
      high salinity environment. About one fourth of the total variation in community
      structure resulted from covariation of salinity and the overall chemical
      composition, which might indicate that the chemical profile was also related to
      salinity. The most prevalent bacterial phyla associated with the mangrove soils
      analyzed included Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes,
      Acidobacteria, and Cyanobacteria. Taxonomic and functional comparisons of our
      results for whole-genome sequencing with available data from other biomes showed 
      that the studied microbiomes cluster first according to biome type, then to
      matrix type and salinity status. Metabolic functions were more conserved than
      organisms within mangroves and across all biomes, indicating that core functions 
      are preserved in any of the given conditions regardless of the specific organisms
      harboring them.

TI  - Reproducible changes in the gut microbiome suggest a shift in microbial and host 
      metabolism during spaceflight.
PG  - 113
LID - 10.1186/s40168-019-0724-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Space environment imposes a range of challenges to mammalian
      physiology and the gut microbiota, and interactions between the two are thought
      to be important in mammalian health in space. While previous findings have
      demonstrated a change in the gut microbial community structure during
      spaceflight, specific environmental factors that alter the gut microbiome and the
      functional relevance of the microbiome changes during spaceflight remain elusive.
      METHODS: We profiled the microbiome using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in
      fecal samples collected from mice after a 37-day spaceflight onboard the
      International Space Station. We developed an analytical tool, named STARMAPs
      (Similarity Test for Accordant and Reproducible Microbiome Abundance Patterns),
      to compare microbiome changes reported here to other relevant datasets. We also
      integrated the gut microbiome data with the publically available transcriptomic
      data in the liver of the same animals for a systems-level analysis. RESULTS: We
      report an elevated microbiome alpha diversity and an altered microbial community 
      structure that were associated with spaceflight environment. Using STARMAPs, we
      found the observed microbiome changes shared similarity with data reported in
      mice flown in a previous space shuttle mission, suggesting reproducibility of the
      effects of spaceflight on the gut microbiome. However, such changes were not
      comparable with those induced by space-type radiation in Earth-based studies. We 
      found spaceflight led to significantly altered taxon abundance in one order, one 
      family, five genera, and six species of microbes. This was accompanied by a
      change in the inferred microbial gene abundance that suggests an altered capacity
      in energy metabolism. Finally, we identified host genes whose expression in the
      liver were concordantly altered with the inferred gut microbial gene content,
      particularly highlighting a relationship between host genes involved in protein
      metabolism and microbial genes involved in putrescine degradation. CONCLUSIONS:
      These observations shed light on the specific environmental factors that
      contributed to a robust effect on the gut microbiome during spaceflight with
      important implications for mammalian metabolism. Our findings represent a key
      step toward a better understanding the role of the gut microbiome in mammalian
      health during spaceflight and provide a basis for future efforts to develop
      microbiota-based countermeasures that mitigate risks to crew health during
      long-term human space expeditions.

AB  - The aim of this study was to gain insight into the bacterial composition and
      dynamics in a mineral water treatment system (MWTS). The bacterial community of a
      full-scale mineral water treatment plant in the Maofeng Mountain, South China,
      was studied using high-throughput sequencing combined with cultivation-based
      techniques in both the dry and wet season. Overall, adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP)
      concentration (6.47 x 10(-11) - 3.32 x 10(-8) M) and heterotrophic plate counts
      (HPC) (3 - 1.29 x 10(3) CFU/mL) of water samples in the wet season were lower
      than those (ATP concentration 5.10 x 10(-11) - 6.96 x 10(-8) M, HPC 2 - 1.97 x
      10(3) CFU/mL) in the dry season throughout the whole MWTS. The microbial activity
      and biomass of water samples obviously changed along with treatment process. All 
      300 isolates obtained using cultivation-based techniques were distributed in 5
      phyla, 7 classes, and 19 genera. Proteobacteria accounted for 55.7% (167) of the 
      total isolates, among which predominant genus was Pseudomonas (19.3%). Illumina
      sequencing analysis of 16s rRNA genes revealed 15 bacterial phyla (relative
      abundance >0.1%) as being identified in all water samples. Among these,
      Proteobacteria constituted the dominant bacteria microbiota in all water samples.
      A large shift in the proportion of Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes 
      was obtained during the treatment process, with the proportion of Bacteroidetes, 
      Actinobacteria decreasing sharply, whereas that of Firmicutes increased and
      predominated in the final water product. The core microbiome, which was still
      present in whole MWTS comprised several genera including Pseudomonas,
      Acinetobacter, Clostridium, and Mycobacterium, that contain species that are
      opportunistic pathogens, suggesting a potential threat for mineral water
      microbiology safety. This study is the first to investigate the bacterial
      community of a full-scale mineral water treatment plant in China. The results
      provided data regarding the bacteria composition and dynamics in an MWTS, which
      will contribute to the beneficial manipulation of the mineral water microbiome.

AB  - This study first evaluated the process performances and microbial community
      structures of anaerobic rotary membrane bioreactor (ARMBR) fed with food waste
      recycling wastewater (FRW). Three identical ARMBRs were operated under different 
      organic loading rate (OLR) conditions (1.5, 3.0, and 6.0kg COD m(-3) d(-1)) after
      the same start-up periods. The start-up performances and archaeal community
      structures differed among the ARMBRs, probably due to the sudden OLR shock. After
      the start-up, bio-methane was stably produced until the end of the operational
      period, with all of the ARMBRs showing >95% COD removal efficiency. Methanosaeta 
      spp. was the predominant methanogen; diverse hydrogenotrophic methanogens
      co-existed. Bacteroidetes-like bacteria and Candidatus Cloacamonas acted as major
      fermentative bacteria producing acetate or hydrogen for the growth of
      methanogens. The results suggest that our ARMBR system can be a promising option 
      to manage high-strength organic wastewater such as FRW.

AB  - Endolithic growth within rocks is a critical adaptation of microbes living in
      harsh environments where exposure to extreme temperature, radiation, and
      desiccation limits the predominant life forms, such as in the ice-free regions of
      Continental Antarctica. The microbial diversity of the endolithic communities in 
      these areas has been sparsely examined. In this work, diversity and composition
      of bacterial assemblages in the cryptoendolithic lichen-dominated communities of 
      Victoria Land (Continental Antarctica) were explored using a high-throughput
      metabarcoding approach, targeting the V4 region of 16S rDNA. Rocks were collected
      in 12 different localities (from 14 different sites), along a gradient ranging
      from 1000 to 3300 m a.s.l. and at a sea distance ranging from 29 to 96 km. The
      results indicate Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria are the dominant taxa in all
      samples and defined a 'core' group of bacterial taxa across all sites. The
      structure of bacteria communities is correlated with the fungal counterpart and
      among the environmental parameters considered, altitude was found to influence
      bacterial biodiversity, while distance from sea had no evident influence.

AB  - Hospital-acquired infections remain a serious threat to human life and are
      becoming a top public health issue. As the latest advances in sequencing
      technologies have allowed the unbiased identification of bacterial communities,
      we aimed to implement emerging omics technologies to characterize a hospital's
      microbiome at the center of Cairo, Egypt. To this end, we screened surfaces and
      inanimate objects in the hospital, focusing on bed sheets and door knobs, with
      additional screening for resistant microbes and resistance genes. While bacterial
      load and community composition were not dramatically different between door knobs
      of hospital units with different hygiene levels, the bacterial communities on
      door knob samples were richer and more diverse than those detected on bed sheets.
      Bacteria detected on door knobs were a mix of those associated with
      dust/particulate matter/debris (e.g., Bacillus, Geobacillus, Aeribacillus) and
      skin-associated bacteria (e.g., Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium). The latter were
      among the core genera shared by all analyzed samples. Conversely, bacteria that
      were more abundant in bed sheets were not associated with a particular source
      (e.g., Pseudomonas and Nitrobacter). Resistance screening indicated an expansion 
      of a mobile beta-lactamase-encoding gene (blaTEM), reflecting its current global 
      spread. This study is a first step toward more comprehensive screening of
      hospital surfaces and correlating their microbiome with hospital outbreaks or
      chronic infections. We conclude that, as hospitals are unique built environments,
      these findings can inform future infection control strategies in hospitals and
      health care-related built environments, and attest to the importance of the
      emerging hospital microbiome research field.

PG  - 11356
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-47701-8 [doi]
AB  - Microbiomes of multicellular organisms are one of the hottest topics in
      microbiology and physiology, while only few studies addressed bacterial
      communities associated with protists. Protists are widespread in all environments
      and can be colonized by plethora of different bacteria, including also human
      pathogens. The aim of this study was to characterize the prokaryotic community
      associated with the sessile ciliate Stentor coeruleus. 16S rRNA gene
      metabarcoding was performed on single cells of S. coeruleus and on their
      environment, water from the sewage stream. Our results showed that the
      prokaryotic community composition differed significantly between Stentor cells
      and their environment. The core microbiome common for all ciliate specimens
      analyzed could be defined, and it was composed mainly by representatives of
      bacterial genera which include also potential human pathogens and commensals,
      such as Neisseria, Streptococcus, Capnocytophaga, Porphyromonas. Numerous 16S
      rRNA gene contigs belonged to endosymbiont "Candidatus Megaira polyxenophila".
      Our data suggest that each ciliate cell can be considered as an ecological
      microniche harboring diverse prokaryotic organisms. Possible benefits for
      persistence and transmission in nature for bacteria associated with protists are 
      discussed. Our results support the hypothesis that ciliates attract potentially
      pathogenic bacteria and play the role of natural reservoirs for them.

TI  - Alterations in the Endophyte-Enriched Root-Associated Microbiome of Rice
      Receiving Growth-Promoting Treatments of Urea Fertilizer and Rhizobium
      Biofertilizer.

AB  - We examined the bacterial endophyte-enriched root-associated microbiome within
      rice (Oryza sativa) 55 days after growth in soil with and without urea fertilizer
      and/or biofertilization with a growth-promotive bacterial strain (Rhizobium
      leguminosarum bv. trifolii E11). After treatment to deplete
      rhizosphere/rhizoplane communities, washed roots were macerated and their
      endophyte-enriched communities were analyzed by 16S ribosomal DNA 454 amplicon
      pyrosequencing. This analysis clustered 99,990 valid sequence reads into 1105
      operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with 97% sequence identity, 133 of which
      represented a consolidated core assemblage representing 12.04% of the fully
      detected OTU richness. Taxonomic affiliations indicated Proteobacteria as the
      most abundant phylum (especially alpha- and gamma-Proteobacteria classes),
      followed by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, and
      several other phyla. Dominant genera included Rheinheimera, unclassified
      Rhodospirillaceae, Pseudomonas, Asticcacaulis, Sphingomonas, and Rhizobium.
      Several OTUs had close taxonomic affiliation to genera of diazotrophic
      rhizobacteria, including Rhizobium, unclassified Rhizobiales, Azospirillum,
      Azoarcus, unclassified Rhizobiaceae, Bradyrhizobium, Azonexus, Mesorhizobium,
      Devosia, Azovibrio, Azospira, Azomonas, and Azotobacter. The endophyte-enriched
      microbiome was restructured within roots receiving growth-promoting treatments.
      Compared to the untreated control, endophyte-enriched communities receiving urea 
      and/or biofertilizer treatments were significantly reduced in OTU richness and
      relative read abundances. Several unique OTUs were enriched in each of the
      treatment communities. These alterations in structure of root-associated
      communities suggest dynamic interactions in the host plant microbiome, some of
      which may influence the well-documented positive synergistic impact of rhizobial 
      biofertilizer inoculation plus low doses of urea-N fertilizer on growth promotion
      of rice, considered as one of the world's most important food crops.

      Community With Host Ontogeny.

AB  - Bacterial communities are fundamental symbionts of corals. However, the process
      by which bacterial communities are acquired across the life history of corals,
      particularly in larval and early juvenile stages, is still poorly characterized. 
      Here, transfer of bacteria of the Scleractinian coral Acropora digitifera from
      adults to spawned egg-sperm bundles was analyzed, as well as acquisition across
      early developmental stages (larvae and newly settled spat), and 6-month-old
      juveniles. Larvae were reared under manipulated environmental conditions to
      determine the source (maternal, seawater, or sediment) of bacteria likely to
      establish symbiotic relationships with the host using amplicon sequencing of the 
      16S rRNA gene. Maternal colonies directly transferred bacteria from the families 
      Rhodobacteraceae, Cryomorphaceae, and Endozoicimonaceae to egg-sperm bundles.
      Furthermore, significant differences in the microbial community structure were
      identified across generations, yet the structure of the coral bacterial community
      across early life history stages was not impacted by different environmental
      rearing conditions. These data indicate that the uptake and structure of
      bacterial communities is developmentally, rather than environmentally, regulated.
      Both maternal coral colonies and ubiquitous bacteria found across environmental
      substrates represent a potential source of symbionts important in establishing
      the coral microbiome. Uniquely, we report the presence of variation with ontogeny
      of both the core and resident bacterial communities, supporting the hypothesis
      that microbial communities are likely to play specific roles within the distinct 
      life history stages of the coral host.

AB  - Elucidating the role of prokaryotic symbionts in mediating host physiology has
      emerged as an important area of research. Since oysters are the world's most
      heavily cultivated bivalve molluscs, numerous studies have applied molecular
      techniques to understand the taxonomic and functional diversity of their
      associated bacteria. Here, we expand on this research by assessing the
      composition and putative functional profiles of prokaryotic communities from
      different organs/compartments of the black-lipped pearl oyster Pinctada
      margaritifera, a commercially important shellfish valued for cultured pearl
      production in the Pacific region. Seven tissues, in addition to mucous
      secretions, were targeted from P. margaritifera individuals: the gill, gonad,
      byssus gland, haemolymph, mantle, adductor muscle, mucus, and gut. Richness of
      bacterial Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and phylogenetic diversity differed 
      between host tissues, with mucous layers displaying the highest richness and
      diversity. This multi-tissues approach permitted the identification of consistent
      microbial members, together constituting the core microbiome of P. margaritifera,
      including Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriia, and Spirochaetes. We
      also found a high representation of Endozoicimonaceae symbionts, indicating that 
      they may be of particular importance to oyster health, survival and homeostasis, 
      as in many other coral reef animals. Our study demonstrates that the microbial
      communities and their associated predicted functional profiles are tissue
      specific. Inferred physiological functions were supported by current
      physiological data available for the associated bacterial taxa specific to each
      tissue. This work provides the first baseline of microbial community composition 
      in P. margaritifera, providing a solid foundation for future research into this
      commercially important species and emphasises the important effects of tissue
      differentiation in structuring the oyster microbiome.

      Ircinia campana.
PG  - 1684-1695
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13065 [doi]
AB  - Marine sponges are hosts to large, diverse communities of microorganisms. These
      microbiomes are distinct among sponge species and from seawater bacterial
      communities, indicating a key role of host identity in shaping its resident
      microbial community. However, the factors governing intraspecific microbiome
      variability are underexplored and may shed light on the evolutionary and
      ecological relationships between host and microbiome. Here, we examined the
      influence of genetic variation and geographic location on the composition of the 
      Ircinia campana microbiome. We developed new microsatellite markers to genotype
      I. campana from two locations in the Florida Keys, USA, and characterized their
      microbiomes using V4 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We show that microbial
      community composition and diversity is influenced by host genotype, with more
      genetically similar sponges hosting more similar microbial communities. We also
      found that although I. campana was not genetically differentiated between sites, 
      microbiome composition differed by location. Our results demonstrate that both
      host genetics and geography influence the composition of the sponge microbiome.
      Host genotypic influence on microbiome composition may be due to stable vertical 
      transmission of the microbial community from parent to offspring, making
      microbiomes more similar by descent. Alternatively, sponge genotypic variation
      may reflect variation in functional traits that influence the acquisition of
      environmental microbes. This study reveals drivers of microbiome variation within
      and among locations, and shows the importance of intraspecific variability in
      mediating eco-evolutionary dynamics of host-associated microbiomes.

      cover soil.
PG  - 1283-1295
LID - 10.1007/s10295-019-02217-y [doi]
AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills are the third largest anthropogenic source 
      of methane (CH4) emissions in the United States. The majority of CH4 generated in
      landfills is converted to carbon dioxide (CO2) by CH4-oxidizing bacteria (MOB)
      present in the landfill cover soil, whose activity is controlled by various
      environmental factors including temperature. As landfill temperature can
      fluctuate substantially seasonally, rates of CH4 oxidation can also vary, and
      this could lead to incomplete oxidation. This study aims at analyzing the effect 
      of temperature on CH4 oxidation potential and microbial community structure of
      methanotrophs in laboratory-based studies of landfill cover soil and cultivated
      consortia. Soil and enrichment cultures were incubated at temperatures ranging
      from 6 to 70 degrees C, and rates of CH4 oxidation were measured, and the
      microbial community structure was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon
      sequencing and shotgun metagenome sequencing. CH4 oxidation occurred at
      temperatures from 6 to 50 degrees C in soil microcosm tests, and 6-40 degrees C
      in enrichment culture batch tests; maximum rates of oxidation were obtained at 30
      degrees C. A corresponding shift in the soil microbiota was observed, with a
      transition from putative psychrophilic to thermophilic methanotrophs with
      increasing incubation temperature. A strong shift in methanotrophic community
      structure was observed above 30 degrees C. At temperatures up to 30 degrees C,
      methanotrophs from the genus Methylobacter were dominant in soils and enrichment 
      cultures; at a temperature of 40 degrees C, putative thermophilic methanotrophs
      from the genus Methylocaldum become dominant. Maximum rate measurements of nearly
      195 mug CH4 g(-1) day(-1) were observed in soil incubations, while observed
      maximum rates in enrichments were significantly lower, likely as a result of
      diffusion limitations. This study demonstrates that temperature is a critical
      factor affecting rates of landfill soil CH4 oxidation in vitro and that changing 
      rates of CH4 oxidation are in part driven by changes in methylotroph community
      structure.

TI  - Mining the Drilosphere: Bacterial Communities and Denitrifier Abundance in a
      No-Till Wheat Cropping System.
PG  - 1339
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.01339 [doi]
AB  - Earthworms play important roles in no-till cropping systems by redistributing
      crop residue to lower soil horizons, providing macropores for root growth,
      increasing water infiltration, enhancing soil quality and organic matter, and
      stimulating nitrogen cycling. The soil impacted by earthworm activity, including 
      burrows, casts, and middens, is termed the drilosphere. The objective of this
      study was to determine the effect of earthworms on soil microbial community
      composition in the drilosphere at different landscape slope positions. Soil cores
      (50 cm depth) were extracted from three landscape locations (top, middle, and
      bottom slope positions) on a sloping aspect of a no-till wheat farm. Soil was
      sampled at the bottom of the soil core from inside multiple earthworm (Lumbricus 
      terrestris) channels (drilosphere) and from adjacent bulk soil. Bacterial
      communities were characterized for 16S rRNA gene diversity using high-throughput 
      sequencing and functional denitrifier gene abundance (nirK, nirS, and nosZ) by
      quantitative PCR. Bacterial communities were structured primarily by the
      landscape slope position of the soil core followed by source (bulk versus
      drilosphere soil), with a significant interaction between core position and
      source. The families AKIW874, Chitinophagaceae, and Comamonadaceae and the genera
      Amycolatopsis, Caulobacter, Nocardioides, and Variovorax were more abundant in
      the drilosphere compared to the bulk soil. Most of the individual bacterial taxa 
      enriched in the drilosphere versus bulk soil were members of Actinobacteria,
      including Micrococcales, Gaiellaceae, Solirubrobacterales, and Mycobacterium. In 
      general, the greatest differences in communities were observed in comparisons of 
      the top and bottom slope positions in which the bottom slope communities had
      significantly greater richness, diversity, and denitrifier abundance than the top
      slope position. Populations of denitrifiers (i.e., ratio of nirK+nirS to 16S
      rRNA) were more abundant in earthworm-impacted soils and there was a significant 
      impact of L. terrestris on soil community composition which was observed only in 
      the top landscape position. There were significant correlations between the
      abundance of nirK and nirS and taxa within Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria,
      Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi, suggesting a broad diversity of
      denitrifying bacteria. Earthworms influence the soil microbial communities, but
      the impact depends on the slope location in a variable landscape, which likely
      reflects different soil characteristics.

      waterbodies characterized by 16S rRNA gene amplicon deep sequencing.

AB  - Faecal contamination is one of the major factors affecting biological water
      quality. In this study, we investigated microbial taxonomic diversity of faecally
      polluted lotic ecosystems in Norway. These ecosystems comprise tributaries of
      drinking water reservoirs with moderate and high faecal contamination levels, an 
      urban creek exposed to extremely high faecal pollution and a rural creek that was
      the least faecally polluted. The faecal water contamination had both
      anthropogenic and zoogenic origins identified through quantitative microbial
      source tracking applying host-specific Bacteroidales 16S rRNA genetic markers.
      The microbial community composition revealed that Proteobacteria and
      Bacteroidetes (70-90% relative abundance) were the most dominant bacterial phyla,
      followed by Firmicutes, especially in waters exposed to anthropogenic faecal
      contamination. The core archaeal community consisted of Parvarchaeota (mainly in 
      the tributaries of drinking water reservoirs) and Crenarchaeota (in the rural
      creek). The aquatic microbial diversity was substantially reduced in water with
      severe faecal contamination. In addition, the community compositions diverge
      between waters with dominant anthropogenic or zoogenic pollution origins. These
      findings present novel interpretations of the effect of anthropo-zoogenic faecal 
      water contamination on microbial diversity in lotic ecosystems.

TI  - Community analysis of gut microbiota in hornets, the largest eusocial wasps,

AB  - Gut microbiota are important for various aspects of host physiology, and its
      composition is generally influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic contexts of
      the host. Social bee gut microbiota composition is simple and highly stable
      hypothesized to be due to their unique food habit and social interactions. Here, 
      we focused on hornets, the largest of the eusocial wasps - Vespa mandarinia and
      V. simillima. Unlike the well-studied honey bees, adult hornets are generally
      herbivorous but also hunt insects for broods, a unique behavior which could
      influence their gut microbiota. Analysis of the gut microbiome using 16S rRNA
      gene sequencing revealed that the two species have simple gut microbiota,
      composed of seven or eight consistently maintained 'core' operational taxonomic
      units (OTUs). While the two Vespa species shared some OTUs, the structures of
      their gut communities differed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated association of
      core OTUs with host diet. Intriguingly, prey honey bee gut microbes were detected
      in the V. simillima gut (and to a lesser extent in V. mandarinia), suggesting
      migration of microorganisms from the prey gut. This is the first report
      uncovering gut microbiome in hornets, giving additional insight into how food
      habit affects gut microbiota of social insects.

AB  - Bacterial communities are resilient to the environmental changes, yet the effect 
      of long term ecological changes on bacterial communities remain poorly explored. 
      To study the effect of prolonged environmental changes, a 25m long sediment core 
      was excavated from a paleo beach ridge located on the Cauvery delta, south east
      coast of India. Geological evidences suggested that the site has experienced
      multiple marine transgressions and regressions. The three paleosols from
      Vettaikaraniruppu (VKI) beach ridge, VKI-2 (2.8m bgl; 3kybp), VKI-5 (7.2m bgl; 6 
      kybp) and VKI-14 (24.5m bgl; 146 kybp) was chosen for bacterial community
      analysis based on their formation period. Bacterial community structure of
      paleosols was reconstructed using V3 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rDNA
      targeted Illumina sequencing. The VKI-5 sediment layer which formed under marine 
      environment contained highest bacterial diversity, and the community was a mix up
      of terrestrial and marine bacterial population. The final community VKI-2
      exhibited an approximate structural pattern witnessed in the native bacterial
      community VKI-14 which formed during marine regression. Furthermore, marine
      transgression and regression experienced in VKI resulted in the formation of
      distinct biogeographic patterns.

AB  - Colorectal cancer is a heterogenous and mostly sporadic disease, the development 
      of which is associated with microbial dysbiosis. Recent advances in subtype
      classification have successfully stratified the disease using molecular
      profiling. To understand potential relationships between molecular mechanisms
      differentiating the subtypes of colorectal cancer and composition of gut
      microbial community, we classified a set of 34 tumour samples into molecular
      subtypes using RNA-sequencing gene expression profiles and determined relative
      abundances of bacterial taxonomic groups. To identify bacterial community
      composition, 16S rRNA amplicon metabarcoding was used as well as whole genome
      metagenomics of the non-human part of RNA-sequencing data. The generated data
      expands the collection of the data sources related to the disease and connects
      molecular aspects of the cancer with environmental impact of microbial community.

TI  - Protein and carbohydrate intakes alter gut microbial community structure in
      crickets: a Geometric Framework approach.

AB  - Proteins and carbohydrates have profound impacts on the ecology of gut
      microbiota, but disentangling the single and interactive effects of different
      dietary constituents is challenging. Here, we used a multidimensional approach,
      the Geometric Framework, to study the interactions between nutrition and
      bacterial abundances with respect to protein and carbohydrate intakes in field
      cricket, Teleogryllus oceanicus. Our study revealed that species richness
      decreased as crickets consumed more macronutrients, and species evenness peaked
      at high intake of protein-rich diets. Sex and protein:carbohydrate (P:C) ratios
      in diets were the primary factors influencing the gut bacterial community, but
      most of the microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that were significantly 
      different between males and females were present in low abundance. In contrast,
      protein intake had a greater influence than carbohydrate consumption on the
      relative abundances of the core bacterial taxa, as an increase in dietary protein
      availability could remove the growth constraint imposed by limited nitrogen.
      Taken together, the use of the Geometric Framework provides a deeper insight into
      how nutritional intakes influence the relative abundances of gut microbes, and
      could be a useful tool to integrate the study of gut microbiome and fitness
      traits in a host.

      Distributions in Recirculating Aquaculture and Aquaponic Systems.
LID - e00143-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSphere.00143-19 [doi]
AB  - Flowthrough and pond aquaculture system microbiome management practices aim to
      mitigate fish disease and stress. However, the operational success of
      recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) depends directly on system microbial
      community activities. In RAS, each component environment is engineered for a
      specific microbial niche for waste management, as the water continuously flowing 
      through the system must be processed before returning to the rearing tank. In
      this study, we compared waste management component microbiomes (rearing tank
      water, pH correction tank, solid-waste clarifier, biofilter, and degassing tower)
      within a commercial-scale freshwater RAS by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene
      sequencing. To assess consistency among freshwater RAS microbiomes, we also
      compared the microbial community compositions of six aquaculture and aquaponic
      farms. Community assemblages reflected site and source water relationships, and
      the presence of a hydroponic subsystem was a major community determinant. In
      contrast to the facility-specific community composition, some sequence variants, 
      mainly classified into Flavobacterium, Cetobacterium, the family
      Sphingomonadaceae, and nitrifying guilds of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and
      Nitrospira, were common across all facilities. The findings of this study suggest
      that, independently of system design, core taxa exist across RAS rearing similar 
      fish species but that system design informs the individual aquatic microbiome
      assemblages. Future RAS design would benefit from understanding the roles of
      these core taxa and then capitalizing on their activities to further reduce
      system waste/added operational controls.IMPORTANCE Recirculating aquaculture
      systems (RAS) are agroecosystems for intensive on-land cultivation of products of
      fisheries. Practitioners that incorporate edible plant production into RAS refer 
      to these facilities as aquaponic systems (AP). RAS have the potential to offset
      declining production levels of wild global fisheries while reducing waste and
      product distance to market, but system optimization is needed to reduce costs.
      Both RAS and AP rely on microbial consortia for maintaining water quality and
      promoting fish/plant health, but little is known about the microorganisms
      actually present. This lack of knowledge prevents optimization of designs and
      operational controls to target the growth of beneficial microbial species or
      consortia. The significance of our research is in identifying the common
      microorganisms that inhabit production RAS and AP and the operational factors
      that influence which microorganisms colonize and become abundant. Identifying
      these organisms is a first step toward advanced control of microbial activities
      that improve reproducibility and reduce costs.

TI  - Interannual comparison of core taxa and community composition of the blow
      microbiota from East Australian humpback whales.
LID - fiz102 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsec/fiz102 [doi]
AB  - Cetacean represent vulnerable species impacted by multiple stressors, including
      reduction in prey species, habitat destruction, whaling and infectious disease.
      The composition of blow microbiota has been claimed to provide a promising tool
      for non-invasive health monitoring aiming to inform conservation management.
      Still, little is known about the temporal stability and composition of blow
      microbiota in whales. We used East Australian humpback whales (Megaptera
      novaeangliae) as a model species and collected blow and control samples in August
      2016 and 2017 for an interannual comparison. We analysed the blow by barcode tag 
      sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene. We found that the microbial
      communities in 2016 and 2017 were statistically similar regarding alpha and beta 
      diversity but distinct to seawater. Zero-radius operational taxonomic units
      (zOTUs) shared by both groups accounted for about 50% of all zOTUs present.
      Still, the large individual variability in the blow microbiota resulted in a
      small number of core taxa (defined as present in at least 60% of whales). We
      conclude that the blow microbiota of humpback whales is either generally limited 
      and of transient nature or the reduced airway microbiota is the symptom of a
      compromised physiological state potentially due to the challenges of the whales' 
      annual migration.

      Through Holocene Ice Core From Scarisoara Ice Cave, Romania.

AB  - Our understanding of the icy-habitat microbiome is likely limited by a lack of
      reliable data on microorganisms inhabiting underground ice that has accumulated
      inside caves. To characterize how environmental variation impacts cave ice
      microbial community structure, we determined the composition of total and
      potentially active bacterial communities along a 13,000-year-old ice core from
      Scarisoara cave (Romania) through 16S rRNA gene Illumina sequencing. An average
      of 2,546 prokaryotic gDNA operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and 585 cDNA OTUs
      were identified across the perennial cave ice block and analyzed in relation to
      the geochemical composition of ice layers. The total microbial community and the 
      putative active fraction displayed dissimilar taxa profiles. The ice-contained
      microbiome was dominated by Actinobacteria with a variable representation of
      Proteobacteria, while the putative active microbial community was equally shared 
      between Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Accordingly, a major presence of
      Cryobacterium, Lysinomonas, Pedobacter, and Aeromicrobium phylotypes homologous
      to psychrotrophic and psychrophilic bacteria from various cold environments were 
      noted in the total community, while the prevalent putative active bacteria
      belonged to Clostridium, Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, and
      Massilia genera. Variation in the microbial cell density of ice strata with the
      dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and the strong correlation of DOC and
      silicon concentrations revealed a major impact of depositional processes on
      microbial abundance throughout the ice block. Post-depositional processes
      appeared to occur mostly during the 4,000-7,000 years BP interval. A major
      bacterial composition shift was observed in 4,500-5,000-year-old ice, leading to 
      a high representation of Beta- and Deltaproteobacteria in the potentially active 
      community in response to the increased concentrations of DOC and major chemical
      elements. Estimated metabolic rates suggested the presence of a viable microbial 
      community within the cave ice block, characterized by a maintenance metabolism in
      most strata and growth capacity in those ice deposits with high microbial
      abundance and DOC content. This first survey of microbial distribution in
      perennial cave ice formed since the Last Glacial period revealed a complex
      potentially active community, highlighting major shifts in community composition 
      associated with geochemical changes that took place during climatic events that
      occurred about 5,000 years ago, with putative formation of photosynthetic
      biofilms.

AB  - Plant microbiota is a key determinant of plant health and productivity. The
      composition and structure of plant microbiota varies according to plant tissue
      and compartment, which are specific habitats for microbial colonization. To
      investigate the structural composition of the microbiome associated with tomato
      roots under natural systems, we characterized the bacterial, archaeal, and fungal
      communities of three belowground compartments (rhizosphere, endosphere, and bulk 
      soil) of tomato plants collected from 23 greenhouses in 7 geographic locations of
      South Korea. The microbial diversity and structure varied by rhizocompartment,
      with the most distinctive community features found in the endosphere. The
      bacterial and fungal communities in the bulk soil and rhizosphere were correlated
      with soil physicochemical properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity, and
      exchangeable cation levels, while this trend was not evident in the endosphere
      samples. A small number of core bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
      present in all samples from the rhizosphere and endosphere represented more than 
      60% of the total relative abundance. Among these core microbes, OTUs belonging to
      the genera Acidovorax, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Streptomyces, and
      Variovorax, members of which are known to have beneficial effects on plant
      growth, were more relatively abundant in the endosphere samples. A co-occurrence 
      network analysis indicated that the microbial community in the rhizosphere had a 
      larger and more complex network than those in the bulk soil and endosphere. The
      analysis also identified keystone taxa that might play important roles in
      microbe-microbe interactions in the community. Additionally, profiling of
      predicted gene functions identified many genes associated with membrane transport
      in the endospheric and rhizospheric communities. Overall, the data presented here
      provide preliminary insight into bacterial, archaeal, and fungal phylogeny,
      functionality, and interactions in the rhizocompartments of tomato roots under
      real-world environments.

TI  - Relationship between the respiratory microbiome and the severity of airflow
      limitation, history of exacerbations and circulating eosinophils in COPD
      patients.
PG  - 112
LID - 10.1186/s12890-019-0867-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The respiratory microbiome is altered in COPD patients but its
      relationship with core components of the disease, such as the severity of airflow
      limitation, the frequency of exacerbations or the circulating levels of
      eosinophils, is unclear. METHODS: Cross-sectional study comprising 72 clinically 
      stable COPD patients (mean age 68 [SD 7.9] years; FEV1 48.7 [SD 20.1]% of
      reference) who provided spontaneous sputum samples for 16S rRNA gene
      amplification and sequencing. The microbiome composition was analysed with QIIME.
      RESULTS: We observed that: (1) more severe airflow limitation was associated with
      reduced relative abundance (RA) of Treponema and an increase in Pseudomonas; (2) 
      patients with >/=2 exacerbations the previous year showed a significantly
      different bacterial community with respect to non-exacerbators (p = 0.014), with 
      changes in 13 genera, including an increase of Pseudomonas, and finally, (3)
      peripheral eosinophils levels >/=2% were associated with more diverse microbiome 
      [Chao1 224.51 (74.88) vs 277.39 (78.92) p = 0.006; Shannon 3.94 (1.05) vs 4.54
      (1.06) p = 0.020], and a significant increase in the RAs of 20 genera.
      CONCLUSION: The respiratory microbiome in clinically stable COPD patients varies 
      significantly according to the severity of airflow limitation, previous history
      of exacerbations and circulating eosinophils levels.

PG  - e7121
LID - 10.7717/peerj.7121 [doi]
AB  - Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of complex microbial genomic DNA
      templates with degenerate primers can lead to distortion of the underlying
      community structure due to inefficient primer-template interactions leading to
      bias. We previously described a method of deconstructed PCR ("PEX PCR") to
      separate linear copying and exponential amplification stages of PCR to reduce PCR
      bias. In this manuscript, we describe an improved deconstructed PCR ("DePCR")
      protocol separating linear and exponential stages of PCR and allowing higher
      throughput of sample processing. We demonstrate that the new protocol shares the 
      same benefits of the original and show that the protocol dramatically and
      significantly decreases the formation of chimeric sequences during PCR. By
      employing PCR with annealing temperature gradients, we further show that there is
      a strong negative correlation between annealing temperature and the evenness of
      primer utilization in a complex pool of degenerate primers. Shifting primer
      utilization patterns mirrored shifts in observed microbial community structure in
      a complex microbial DNA template. We further employed the DePCR method to amplify
      the same microbial DNA template independently with each primer variant from a
      degenerate primer pool. The non-degenerate primers generated a broad range of
      observed microbial communities, but some were highly similar to communities
      observed with degenerate primer pools. The same experiment conducted with
      standard PCR led to consistently divergent observed microbial community
      structure. The DePCR method is simple to perform, is limited to PCR mixes and
      cleanup steps, and is recommended for reactions in which degenerate primer pools 
      are used or when mismatches between primers and template are possible.

AB  - In this study, the role of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) in nitrogen 
      removal and the microbial community structure of aerobic granular sludge (AGS)
      were analyzed under different dissolved oxygen (DO) conditions (6-7, 4-5, and
      2-3mg.L(-1)). The EPSs transported and retained nitrogen in the denitrification
      process, and the total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) in the EPSs decreased from 6.09
      to 5.54mg.g(-1) MLSS when the DO concentration decreased from 6-7 to 2-3mg.L(-1).
      The microbial community showed different core denitrifying bacterial populations 
      involved in nitrogen removal in the AGS system under different DO conditions,
      with more species when they were higher relative abundances of denitrifying
      bacteria participating in the nitrogen removal process in AGS under low DO
      conditions, including Hydrogenophilaceae, Thauera, Enterobacter,
      Xanthomonadaceae_unclassified, Comalmonadaceae_unclassified, Nitrosomonas and
      Paracoccus. This study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the DO
      effect on the TIN removal mechanism by AGS.

TI  - Diversity and temporal dynamics of primate milk microbiomes.
PG  - e22994
LID - 10.1002/ajp.22994 [doi]
AB  - Milk is inhabited by a community of bacteria and is one of the first postnatal
      sources of microbial exposure for mammalian young. Bacteria in breast milk may
      enhance immune development, improve intestinal health, and stimulate the
      gut-brain axis for infants. Variation in milk microbiome structure (e.g.,
      operational taxonomic unit [OTU] diversity, community composition) may lead to
      different infant developmental outcomes. Milk microbiome structure may depend on 
      evolutionary processes acting at the host species level and ecological processes 
      occurring over lactation time, among others. We quantified milk microbiomes using
      16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing for nine primate species and for six primate 
      mothers sampled over lactation. Our data set included humans (Homo sapiens,
      Philippines and USA) and eight nonhuman primate species living in captivity
      (bonobo [Pan paniscus], chimpanzee [Pan troglodytes], western lowland gorilla
      [Gorilla gorilla gorilla], Bornean orangutan [Pongo pygmaeus], Sumatran orangutan
      [Pongo abelii], rhesus macaque [Macaca mulatta], owl monkey [Aotus nancymaae])
      and in the wild (mantled howler monkey [Alouatta palliata]). For a subset of the 
      data, we paired microbiome data with nutrient and hormone assay results to
      quantify the effect of milk chemistry on milk microbiomes. We detected a core
      primate milk microbiome of seven bacterial OTUs indicating a robust relationship 
      between these bacteria and primate species. Milk microbiomes differed among
      primate species with rhesus macaques, humans and mantled howler monkeys having
      notably distinct milk microbiomes. Gross energy in milk from protein and fat
      explained some of the variations in microbiome composition among species.
      Microbiome composition changed in a predictable manner for three primate mothers 
      over lactation time, suggesting that different bacterial communities may be
      selected for as the infant ages. Our results contribute to understanding
      ecological and evolutionary relationships between bacteria and primate hosts,
      which can have applied benefits for humans and endangered primates in our care.

TI  - Space, time and captivity: quantifying the factors influencing the fecal
      microbiome of an alpine ungulate.

AB  - The community of microorganisms in the gut is affected by host species, diet and 
      environment and is linked to normal functioning of the host organism. Although
      the microbiome fluctuates in response to host demands and environmental changes, 
      there are core groups of microorganisms that remain relatively constant
      throughout the hosts lifetime. Ruminants are mammals that rely on highly
      specialized digestive and metabolic modifications, including microbiome
      adaptations, to persist in extreme environments. Here, we assayed the fecal
      microbiome of four mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations in western
      North America. We quantified fecal microbiome diversity and composition among
      groups in the wild and captivity, across populations and in a single group over
      time. There were no differences in community evenness or diversity across groups,
      although we observed a decreasing diversity trend across summer months. Pairwise 
      sample estimates grouped the captive population distinctly from the wild
      populations, and moderately grouped the southern wild group distinctly from the
      two northern wild populations. We identified 33 genera modified by captivity,
      with major differences in key groups associated with cellulose degradation that
      likely reflect differences in diet. Our findings are consistent with other
      ruminant studies and provide baseline microbiome data in this enigmatic species, 
      offering valuable insights into the health of wild alpine ungulates.

      species across clades and niches.
PG  - 2500-2522
LID - 10.1038/s41396-019-0450-8 [doi]
AB  - Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus species are relevant human commensals and
      opportunistic pathogens. Consequently, their bacteriophages may have significant 
      impact on human microbial ecology and pathologies. Our aim was to reveal the
      prevalence and diversity of bacteriophages infecting Aggregatibacter and
      Haemophilus species that colonize the human body. Genome mining with comparative 
      genomics, screening of clinical isolates, and profiling of metagenomes allowed
      characterization of 346 phages grouped in 52 clusters and 18 superclusters. Less 
      than 10% of the identified phage clusters were represented by previously
      characterized phages. Prophage diversity patterns varied significantly for
      different phage types, host clades, and environmental niches. A more diverse
      phage community lysogenizes Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae
      strains than Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and "Haemophilus ducreyi".
      Co-infections occurred more often in "H. ducreyi". Phages from Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetemcomitans preferably lysogenized strains of specific serotype.
      Prophage patterns shared by subspecies clades of different bacterial species
      suggest similar ecoevolutionary drivers. Changes in frequencies of DNA uptake
      signal sequences and guanine-cytosine content reflect phage-host long-term
      coevolution. Aggregatibacter and Haemophilus phages were prevalent at multiple
      oral sites. Together, these findings should help exploring the ecoevolutionary
      forces shaping virus-host interactions in the human microbiome. Putative lytic
      phages, especially phiKZ-like, may provide new therapeutic options.

AB  - Improved sequencing and analytical techniques allow for better resolution of
      microbial communities; however, the agriculture field lacks an updated analysis
      surveying the fecal microbial populations of dairy cattle in California. This
      study is a large-scale survey to determine the composition of the bacterial
      community present in the feces of lactating dairy cattle on commercial dairy
      operations. For the study, 10 dairy farms across northern and central California 
      representing a variety of feeding and management systems were enrolled. The farms
      represented three typical housing types including five freestall, two drylot and 
      three pasture-based management systems. Fresh feces were collected from 15
      randomly selected cows on each farm and analyzed using 16S rRNA gene amplicon
      sequencing. This study found that housing type, individual farm, and dietary
      components significantly affected the alpha diversity of the fecal microbiota.
      While only one Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) was common among all the sampled 
      individuals, 15 bacterial families and 27 genera were shared among 95% of
      samples. The ratio of the families Coriobacteriaceae to Bifidobacteriaceae was
      significantly different between housing types and farms with pasture fed animals 
      having a higher relative abundance of Coriobacteriaceae. A majority of samples
      were positive for at least one OTU assigned to Enterobacteriaceae and 31% of
      samples contained OTUs assigned to Campylobacter. However, the relative abundance
      of both taxa was <0.1%. The microbial composition displays individual farm
      specific signatures, but housing type plays a role. These data provide insights
      into the composition of the core fecal microbiota of commercial dairy cows in
      California and will further generate hypotheses for strategies to manipulate the 
      microbiome of cattle.

TI  - Hiseq Base Molecular Characterization of Soil Microbial Community, Diversity
      Structure, and Predictive Functional Profiling in Continuous Cucumber Planted
      Soil Affected by Diverse Cropping Systems in an Intensive Greenhouse Region of
      Northern China.
LID - E2619 [pii]

AB  - Cover crops are key determinants of the ecological stability and sustainability
      of continuous cropping soils. However, their agro-ecological role in
      differentially reshaping the microbiome structure and functioning under a
      degraded agroecosystem remains poorly investigated. Therefore, structural and
      metabolic changes in soil bacterial community composition in response to diverse 
      plant species were assessed. Winter catch leafy vegetables crops were introduced 
      as cover plants in a cucumber-fallow period. The results indicate that cover crop
      diversification promoted beneficial changes in soil chemical and biological
      attributes, which increased crop yields in a cucumber double-cropping system.
      Illumina high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes indicated that the
      bacterial community composition and diversity changed through changes in the soil
      properties. Principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with non-metric
      multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis reveals that the cover planting shaped
      the soil microbiome more than the fallow planting (FC). Among different cropping 
      systems, spinach-cucumber (SC) and non-heading Chinese cabbage-cucumber (NCCC)
      planting systems greatly induced higher soil nutrient function, biological
      activity, and bacterial diversity, thus resulting in higher cucumber yield.
      Quantitative analysis of linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe)
      indicated that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria
      were the potentially functional and active soil microbial taxa. Rhizospheres of
      NCCC, leaf lettuce-cucumber (LLC), coriander-cucumber (CC), and SC planting
      systems created hotspots for metabolic capabilities of abundant functional genes,
      compared to FC. In addition, the predictive metabolic characteristics (metabolism
      and detoxification) associated with host-plant symbiosis could be an important
      ecological signal that provides direct evidence of mediation of soil structure
      stability. Interestingly, the plant density of non-heading Chinese cabbage and
      spinach species was capable of reducing the adverse effect of arsenic (As)
      accumulation by increasing the function of the arsenate reductase pathway.
      Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the relative abundance of the core
      microbiome can be directly and indirectly influenced by certain environmental
      determinants. These short-term findings stress the importance of studying cover
      cropping systems as an efficient biological tool to protect the ecological
      environment. Therefore, we can speculate that leafy crop diversification is
      socially acceptable, economically justifiable, and ecologically adaptable to meet
      the urgent demand for intensive cropping systems to promote positive feedback
      between crop-soil sustainable intensification.

      Seagrass Microbiome.

AB  - Seagrasses are globally distributed marine plants that represent an extremely
      valuable component of coastal ecosystems. Like terrestrial plants, seagrass
      productivity and health are likely to be strongly governed by the structure and
      function of the seagrass microbiome, which will be distributed across a number of
      discrete microenvironments within the plant, including the phyllosphere, the
      endosphere and the rhizosphere, all different in physical and chemical
      conditions. Here we examined patterns in the composition of the microbiome of the
      seagrass Zostera muelleri, within six plant-associated microenvironments sampled 
      across four different coastal locations in New South Wales, Australia. Amplicon
      sequencing approaches were used to characterize the diversity and composition of 
      bacterial, microalgal, and fungal microbiomes and ultimately identify "core
      microbiome" members that were conserved across sampling microenvironments.
      Discrete populations of bacteria, microalgae and fungi were observed within
      specific seagrass microenvironments, including the leaves and roots and rhizomes,
      with "core" taxa found to persist within these microenvironments across
      geographically disparate sampling sites. Bacterial, microalgal and fungal
      community profiles were most strongly governed by intrinsic features of the
      different seagrass microenvironments, whereby microscale differences in community
      composition were greater than the differences observed between sampling regions. 
      However, our results showed differing strengths of microbial preferences at the
      plant scale, since this microenvironmental variability was more pronounced for
      bacteria than it was for microalgae and fungi, suggesting more specific
      interactions between the bacterial consortia and the seagrass host, and
      potentially implying a highly specialized coupling between seagrass and bacterial
      metabolism and ecology. Due to their persistence within a given seagrass
      microenvironment, across geographically discrete sampling locations, we propose
      that the identified "core" microbiome members likely play key roles in seagrass

TI  - Phycosphere Microbial Succession Patterns and Assembly Mechanisms in a Marine
      Dinoflagellate Bloom.

AB  - Given the ecological significance of microorganisms in algal blooming events, it 
      is critical to understand the mechanisms regarding their distribution under
      different conditions. We tested the hypothesis that microbial community
      succession is strongly associated with algal bloom stages, and that the assembly 
      mechanisms are cocontrolled by deterministic and stochastic processes. Community 
      structures and underlying ecological processes of microbial populations (attached
      and free-living bacteria) at three algal bloom stages (pre-, during, and
      postbloom) over a complete dinoflagellate Scrippsiella trochoidea bloom were
      investigated. Both attached and free-living taxa had a strong response to the
      bloom event, and the latter was more sensitive than the former. The contribution 
      of environmental parameters to microbial variability was 40.2%. Interaction
      analysis showed that complex positive or negative correlation networks exist in
      phycosphere microbes. These relationships were the potential drivers of mutualist
      and competitive interactions that impacted bacterial succession. Null model
      analysis showed that the attached bacterial community primarily exhibited
      deterministic processes at pre- and during-bloom stages, while dispersal-related 
      processes contributed to a greater extent at the postbloom stage. In the
      free-living bacterial community, homogeneous selection and dispersal limitation
      dominated in the initial phase, which gave way to more deterministic processes at
      the two later stages. Relative contribution analyses further demonstrated that
      the community turnover of attached bacteria was mainly driven by environmental
      selection, while stochastic factors had partial effects on the assembly of
      free-living bacteria. Taken together, these data demonstrated that a robust link 
      exists between bacterioplankton community structure and bloom progression, and
      phycosphere microbial succession trajectories are cogoverned by both
      deterministic and random processes.IMPORTANCE Disentangling the mechanisms
      shaping bacterioplankton communities during a marine ecological event is a core
      concern for ecologists. Harmful algal bloom (HAB) is a typical ecological
      disaster, and its formation is significantly influenced by alga-bacterium
      interactions. Microbial community shifts during the HAB process are relatively
      well known. However, the assembly processes of microbial communities in an HAB
      are not fully understood, especially the relative influences of deterministic and
      stochastic processes. We therefore analyzed the relative contributions of
      deterministic and stochastic processes during an HAB event. Both free-living and 
      attached bacterial groups had a dramatic response to the HAB, and the relative
      importance of determinism versus stochasticity varied between the two bacterial
      groups at various bloom stages. Environmental factors and biotic interactions
      were the main drivers impacting the microbial shift process. Our results
      strengthen the understanding of the ecological mechanisms controlling microbial
      community patterns during the HAB process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past few decades, most attention to Chinese
      Cordyceps-associated endogenous microorganism was focused on the fungal community
      that creates critical bioactive components. Bacterial community associated with
      Chinese Cordyceps has been previously described; however, most studies were only 
      presenting direct comparisons in the Chinese Cordyceps and its microenvironments.
      In the current study, our objectives were to reveal the bacterial community
      structure composition and predict their function. RESULTS: We collected samples
      of Chinese Cordyceps from five sites located in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and
      used a high throughput sequencing method to compare Chinese Cordyceps-associated 
      bacterial community composition and diversity quantitatively across sites. The
      results indicated that for the Chinese Cordyceps-associated bacterial community
      there is no single core microbiome, which was dominated by the both
      Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Predictive functional profiling suggested a
      location specific function pattern for Chinese Cordyceps and bacteria in the
      external mycelial cortices involved in the biosynthesis of active constituents.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study is firstly used high throughput sequencing method to
      compare the bacterial communities inhabiting Chinese Cordyceps and its
      microhabitat and to reveal composition functional capabilities of the bacteria,
      which will accelerate the study of the functions of bacterial communities in the 
      micro-ecological system of Chinese Cordyceps.

AB  - Liming is a common agronomic practice used for alleviating soil acidification to 
      improve plant growth. However, it is still unclear how liming can affect the gut 
      microbiota composition of soil fauna, and subsequently the nutrient cycling and
      litter decomposition mediated by soil fauna. In the present study the effect of
      liming on the gut microbiota of two types of soil fauna, Folsomia candida, and
      Enchytraeus crypticus was investigated by using 16S rRNA gene high-throughput
      sequencing. The results revealed that there are differences between the gut
      microbial communities of the two types of soil fauna as well as between the gut
      microbiome of the soil fauna and the surrounding soil. Enterobacteriaceae and
      Bacillaceae were the predominant families in the gut microbiota of E. crypticus, 
      while Rickettsiaceae and Moraxellaceae were the predominant families in the gut
      microbiota of F. candida. Liming affected the gut microbiota of E. crypticus at
      both the taxonomical and core microbiota level. The gut microbiota of F. candida 
      was not affected by liming. Structural equation models suggest that 97% of the
      variation in the E. crypticus gut microbiota could be explained by liming-induced
      changes in soil properties and the soil microbial community. The indirect effects
      of liming, caused by a shift in the soil microbial community, contributed more in
      reshaping the gut microbiota of E. crypticus than the direct effects of the
      changed soil properties did. These findings suggest that the effects of liming on
      the gut microbiota composition in soil fauna are species-specific and are likely 
      dependent on the response of the host to changes in soil properties and the soil 
      microbial community.

AB  - A diverse microbiota exists within the airways of individuals with non-cystic
      fibrosis bronchiectasis (nCFB). How the lung microbiome evolves over time, and
      whether changes within the microbiome correlate with future disease progression
      is not yet known. We assessed the microbial community structure of 133 serial
      sputa and subsequent disease course of 29 nCFB patients collected over a span of 
      4-16 years using 16S rRNA paired-end sequencing. Interestingly, no significant
      shifts in the microbial community of individuals were observed during extended
      follow-up suggesting the microbiome remains relatively stable over prolonged
      periods. Samples that were Pseudomonas aeruginosa culture positive displayed
      markedly different microbial community structures compared to those that were
      positive for Haemophilus influenzae. Importantly, patients with sputum of lower
      microbial community diversity were more likely to experience subsequent lung
      function decline as defined by annual change in >/=-1 FEV1% predicted. Shannon
      diversity values <1 were more prevalent in patients with FEV1 decline (P =
      0.002). However, the relative abundance of particular core microbiota
      constituents did not associate with risk of decline. Here we present data
      confirming that the microbiome of nCFB individuals is generally stable, and that 
      microbiome-based measurements may have a prognostic role as biomarkers for nCFB.

TI  - The Combination of 2'-Fucosyllactose with Short-Chain Galacto-Oligosaccharides
      and Long-Chain Fructo-Oligosaccharides that Enhance Influenza Vaccine Responses
      Is Associated with Mucosal Immune Regulation in Mice.
PG  - 856-869
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxz006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A critical role for host-microbe interactions and establishment of
      vaccine responses has been postulated. Human milk oligosaccharides, of which
      2'-fucosyllactose (2'FL) is the most prevalent, are known to alter
      host-associated microbial communities and play a critical role in the immunologic
      development of breastfed infants. OBJECTIVES: Dietary supplementation with a
      combination of 2'FL and prebiotic short-chain (sc) galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)
      and long-chain (lc) fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) was employed to examine human
      milk oligosaccharide effects on immune responsiveness, within a murine influenza 
      vaccination model. METHODS: Female mice (6 wk old, C57Bl/6JOlaHsd) were fed
      either control diet (CON) or scGOS/lcFOS/2'FL-containing diet (GF2F) for 45 d.
      After starting dietary intervention (day 14), mice received a primary influenza
      vaccination (day 0) followed by a booster vaccination (day 21), after which ear
      challenges were conducted to measure vaccine-specific delayed type
      hypersensitivity (DTH). Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels, fecal and cecal
      microbial community structure, short-chain fatty acids, host intestinal gene
      expression and cellular responses in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) were also 
      measured. RESULTS: Relative to CON, mice fed the GF2F diet had increased
      influenza vaccine-specific DTH responses (79.3%; P < 0.01), higher levels of both
      IgG1 (3.2-fold; P < 0.05) and IgG2a (1.2-fold; P < 0.05) in serum, and greater
      percentages of activated B cells (0.3%; P < 0.05), regulatory T cells (1.64%; P <
      0.05), and T-helper 1 cells (2.2%; P < 0.05) in their MLNs. GF2F-fed mice had
      elevated cecal butyric (P < 0.05) and propionic (P < 0.05) acid levels relative
      to CON, which correlated to DTH responses (R2 = 0.22; P = 0.05 and R2 = 0.39; P <
      0.01, respectively). Specific fecal microbial taxa altered in GF2F diet fed mice 
      relative to CON were significantly correlated with the DTH response and IgG2a
      level increases. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary GF2F improved influenza vaccine-specific
      T-helper 1 responses and B cell activation in MLNs and enhanced systemic IgG1 and
      IgG2a concentrations in mice. These immunologic changes are correlated with
      microbial community structure and metabolites.

AB  - In this study, we analysed the diversity and composition of double-stranded DNA
      viral and bacterial communities within the sample of surface coastal water of
      Southern Baikal through metagenomics and deep sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA
      gene, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene analysis has revealed 14 phyla and
      dominance of the 'Actinobacteria' (43.6%), 'Proteobacteria' (25.2%) and
      'Bacteroidetes' (11.5%). The bacterial composition was similar to that obtained
      previously in Lake Baikal littoral zone. Out of 1 030 169 processed virome reads,
      37.4% of sequences (385 421) were identified as viral; 15.1% were identified as
      nonviral and related to the domains Eukarya, Bacteria and Archaea; and 47.5% had 
      no matches in the databases. The identified virotypes belonged to different
      families and were predicted to infect a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to
      mammals. Six families (Myoviridae, Poxviridae, Mimiviridae, Siphoviridae,
      Phycodnaviridae and Podoviridae) were dominant accounting for more than 90% of
      the identified sequences (48.3%, 17.4%, 8.3%, 6.8%, 5.8% and 4.1%, respectively).
      In contrast to other freshwater systems, high percentage of the Poxviridae and
      Mimiviridae was recorded in the water sample of Lake Baikal.

TI  - Characterization of microbial communities in the chicken oviduct and the origin
      of chicken embryo gut microbiota.
PG  - 6838
LID - 10.1038/s41598-019-43280-w [doi]
AB  - The transferred microbiota from mother to baby constitutes the initial infant
      gastrointestinal microbiota and has an important influence on the development and
      health of infants in human. However, the reproductive tract microbiota of avian
      species and its inheritance have rarely been studied. We aimed to characterize
      the microbial community in the chicken reproductive tract and determine the
      origin of the chicken embryo gut microbiota. Microbiota in four different
      portions of chicken oviduct were determined using 16S rRNA metagenomic approach
      with the IonTorrent platform. Additionally, we analyzed the mother hen's magnum
      and cloaca, descendent egg, and embryo gut microbiota. The microbial composition 
      and relative abundance of bacterial genera were stable throughout the entire
      chicken reproductive tract, without significant differences between the different
      parts of the oviduct. The chicken reproductive tract showed a relatively high
      abundance of Lactobacillus species. The number of bacterial species in the
      chicken reproductive tract significantly increased following sexual maturation.
      Core genera analysis detected 21 of common genera in the maternal magnum and
      cloaca, descendent egg shell, egg white, and embryo gut. Some elements of the
      maternal oviduct microbiota appear to be transferred to the embryo through the
      egg white and constitute most of the embryo gut bacterial population.

TI  - Longitudinal homogenization of the microbiome between both occupants and the
      built environment in a cohort of United States Air Force Cadets.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/s40168-019-0686-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbiome of the built environment has important implications
      for human health and wellbeing; however, bidirectional exchange of microbes
      between occupants and surfaces can be confounded by lifestyle, architecture, and 
      external environmental exposures. Here, we present a longitudinal study of United
      States Air Force Academy cadets (n = 34), which have substantial homogeneity in
      lifestyle, diet, and age, all factors that influence the human microbiome. We
      characterized bacterial communities associated with (1) skin and gut samples from
      roommate pairs, (2) four built environment sample locations inside the pairs'
      dormitory rooms, (3) four built environment sample locations within shared spaces
      in the dormitory, and (4) room-matched outdoor samples from the window ledge of
      their rooms. RESULTS: We analyzed 2,170 samples, which generated 21,866 unique
      amplicon sequence variants. Linear convergence of microbial composition and
      structure was observed between an occupants' skin and the dormitory surfaces that
      were only used by that occupant (i.e., desk). Conversely, bacterial community
      beta diversity (weighted Unifrac) convergence between the skin of both roommates 
      and the shared dormitory floor between the two cadet's beds was not seen across
      the entire study population. The sampling period included two semester breaks in 
      which the occupants vacated their rooms; upon their return, the beta diversity
      similarity between their skin and the surfaces had significantly decreased
      compared to before the break (p < 0.05). There was no apparent convergence
      between the gut and building microbiota, with the exception of communal bathroom 
      door-handles, which suggests that neither co-occupancy, diet, or lifestyle
      homogenization had a significant impact on gut microbiome similarity between
      these cadets over the observed time frame. As a result, predictive classifier
      models were able to identify an individual more accurately based on the gut
      microbiota (74%) compared to skin (51%). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our
      knowledge, this is the first study to show an increase in skin microbial
      similarity of two individuals who start living together for the first time and
      who are not genetically related or romantically involved. Cohabitation was
      significantly associated with increased skin microbiota similarity but did not
      significantly influence the gut microbiota. Following a departure from the
      occupied space of several weeks, the skin microbiota, but not the gut microbiota,
      showed a significant reduction in similarity relative to the building. Overall,
      longitudinal observation of these dynamics enables us to dissect the influence of
      occupation, diet, and lifestyle factors on occupant and built environment
      microbial ecology.

AB  - The complex gut microbiota plays a key role in host metabolism and health.
      However, the core microbial communities in the different aged Bactrian camels
      remain totally unclear. We used high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to
      examine the temporal variability of the fecal microbiota in Bactrian camels. At 2
      months of age, the fecal microbiota was composed of Firmicutes, Proteobacteria,
      and Actinobacteria. At 1 and 3 years of age, the fecal microbiota was dominated
      by Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Verrucomicrobia. At the genus level, Blautia,
      Fusobacterium, and Bifidobacterium were more abundant at 2 months of age, as well
      as Escherichia-Shigella. Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005, Akkermansia, and
      Christensenellaceae_R-7_group were the most abundant at 1 and 3 years of age.
      Diversity and stability of the gut microbiota increased with age. There was
      enrichment for genes associated with immune system diseases at 2 months of age.
      This study is the first to investigate the distribution of the gut microbiota in 
      Bactrian camels with different ages and provide a baseline for future camel
      microbiology research.

TI  - The bumble bee microbiome increases survival of bees exposed to selenate
      toxicity.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14641 [doi]
AB  - Bumble bees are important and widespread insect pollinators who face many
      environmental challenges. For example, bees are exposed to the metalloid selenate
      when foraging on pollen and nectar from plants growing in contaminated soils. As 
      it has been shown that the microbiome of animals reduces metalloid toxicity, we
      assayed the ability of the bee microbiome to increase survivorship against
      selenate challenge. We exposed uninoculated or microbiota-inoculated Bombus
      impatiens workers to a field-realistic dose of 0.75 mg l(-1) selenate and found
      that microbiota-inoculated bees survive slightly but significantly longer than
      uninoculated bees. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we found that selenate
      exposure altered gut microbial community composition and relative abundance of
      specific core bacteria. We also grew two core bumble bee microbes - Snodgrassella
      alvi and Lactobacillus bombicola - in selenate-spiked media and found that these 
      bacteria grew in the tested concentrations of 0.001-10 mg l(-1) selenate.
      Furthermore, the genomes of these microbes harbour genes involved in selenate
      detoxification. The bumble bee microbiome slightly increases survivorship when
      the host is exposed to selenate, but the specific mechanisms and colony-level
      benefits under natural settings require further study.

TI  - Gender-Specific Associations Between Saliva Microbiota and Body Size.
PG  - 767
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.00767 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The human intestinal microbiota likely play an important role in the
      development of overweight and obesity. However, the associations between saliva
      microbiota and body mass index (BMI) have been sparsely studied. The aim of this 
      study was to identify the associations between saliva microbiota and body size in
      Finnish children. Methods: The saliva microbiota of 900 Finnish children, aged
      11-14 years with measured height and weight, was characterized using 16S rRNA
      (V3-V4) sequencing. Results: The core saliva microbiota consisted of 14 genera
      that were present in more than 95% of the Finnish children. The saliva microbiota
      profiles were gender-specific with higher alpha-diversity in boys than girls and 
      significant differences between the genders in community composition and
      abundances. Alpha-diversity differed between normal weight and overweight girls
      and between normal weight and obese boys. The composition was dissimilar between 
      normal weight and obese girls, but not in boys. The relative abundance profiles
      differed according to body size. Decrease in commensal saliva bacteria were
      observed in all the body sizes when compared to normal weight children. Notably, 
      the relative abundance of bacteria related to, Veillonella, Prevotella,
      Selenomonas, and Streptococcus was reduced in obese children. Conclusion: Saliva 
      microbiota diversity and composition were significantly associated with body size
      and gender in Finnish children. Body size-specific saliva microbiota profiles
      open new avenues for studying the potential roles of microbiota in weight
      development and management.

TI  - Influence of the Intestinal Microbiota on Colonization Resistance to Salmonella
      and the Shedding Pattern of Naturally Exposed Pigs.
LID - e00021-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00021-19 [doi]
AB  - Salmonella colonization and infection in production animals such as pigs are a
      cause for concern from a public health perspective. Variations in susceptibility 
      to natural infection may be influenced by the intestinal microbiota. Using 16S
      rRNA compositional sequencing, we characterized the fecal microbiome of 15 weaned
      pigs naturally infected with Salmonella at 18, 33, and 45 days postweaning.
      Dissimilarities in microbiota composition were analyzed in relation to Salmonella
      infection status (infected, not infected), serological status, and shedding
      pattern (nonshedders, single-point shedders, intermittent-persistent shedders).
      Global microbiota composition was associated with the infection outcome based on 
      serological analysis. Greater richness within the microbiota postweaning was
      linked to pigs being seronegative at the end of the study at 11 weeks of age.
      Members of the Clostridia, such as Blautia, Roseburia, and Anaerovibrio, were
      more abundant and part of the core microbiome in nonshedder pigs. Cellulolytic
      microbiota (Ruminococcus and Prevotella) were also more abundant in noninfected
      pigs during the weaning and growing stages. Microbial profiling also revealed
      that infected pigs had a higher abundance of Lactobacillus and Oscillospira, the 
      latter also being part of the core microbiome of intermittent-persistent
      shedders. These findings suggest that a lack of microbiome maturation and greater
      proportions of microorganisms associated with suckling increase susceptibility to
      infection. In addition, the persistence of Salmonella shedding may be associated 
      with an enrichment of pathobionts such as Anaerobiospirillum. Overall, these
      results suggest that there may be merit in manipulating certain taxa within the
      porcine intestinal microbial community to increase disease resistance against
      Salmonella in pigs. IMPORTANCE Salmonella is a global threat for public health,
      and pork is one of the main sources of human salmonellosis. However, the complex 
      epidemiology of the infection limits current control strategies aimed at reducing
      the prevalence of this infection in pigs. The present study analyzes for the
      first time the impact of the gut microbiota in Salmonella infection in pigs and
      its shedding pattern in naturally infected growing pigs. Microbiome (16S rRNA
      amplicon) analysis reveals that maturation of the gut microbiome could be a key
      consideration with respect to limiting the infection and shedding of Salmonella
      in pigs. Indeed, seronegative animals had higher richness of the gut microbiota
      early after weaning, and uninfected pigs had higher abundance of strict anaerobes
      from the class Clostridia, results which demonstrate that a fast transition from 
      the suckling microbiota to a postweaning microbiota could be crucial with respect
      to protecting the animals.

TI  - Household composition and the infant fecal microbiome: The INSPIRE study.
PG  - 526-539
LID - 10.1002/ajpa.23843 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Establishment and development of the infant gastrointestinal
      microbiome (GIM) varies cross-culturally and is thought to be influenced by
      factors such as gestational age, birth mode, diet, and antibiotic exposure.
      However, there is little data as to how the composition of infants' households
      may play a role, particularly from a cross-cultural perspective. Here, we
      examined relationships between infant fecal microbiome (IFM)
      diversity/composition and infants' household size, number of siblings, and number
      of other household members. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed 377 fecal samples 
      from healthy, breastfeeding infants across 11 sites in eight different countries 
      (Ethiopia, The Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Peru, Spain, Sweden, and the United States).
      Fecal microbial community structure was determined by amplifying, sequencing, and
      classifying (to the genus level) the V1-V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene.
      Surveys administered to infants' mothers identified household members and
      composition. RESULTS: Our results indicated that household composition
      (represented by the number of cohabitating siblings and other household members) 
      did not have a measurable impact on the bacterial diversity, evenness, or
      richness of the IFM. However, we observed that variation in household composition
      categories did correspond to differential relative abundances of specific taxa,
      namely: Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella. DISCUSSION:
      This study, to our knowledge, is the largest cross-cultural study to date
      examining the association between household composition and the IFM. Our results 
      indicate that the social environment of infants (represented here by the proxy of
      household composition) may influence the bacterial composition of the infant GIM,
      although the mechanism is unknown. A higher number and diversity of cohabitants
      and potential caregivers may facilitate social transmission of beneficial
      bacteria to the infant gastrointestinal tract, by way of shared environment or
      through direct physical and social contact between the maternal-infant dyad and
      other household members. These findings contribute to the discussion concerning
      ways by which infants are influenced by their social environments and add further
      dimensionality to the ongoing exploration of social transmission of gut
      microbiota and the "old friends" hypothesis.

AB  - The microbiota and the gastrointestinal mucus layer play a pivotal role in
      protection against non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Tm) 
      colitis. Here, we analyzed the course of Salmonella colitis in mice lacking a
      functional mucus layer in the gut. Unexpectedly, in contrast to mucus-proficient 
      littermates, genetically deficient mice were protected against Salmonella-induced
      gut inflammation in the streptomycin colitis model. This correlated with
      microbiota alterations and enrichment of the bacterial phylum Deferribacteres.
      Using gnotobiotic mice associated with defined bacterial consortia, we causally
      linked Mucispirillum schaedleri, currently the sole known representative of
      Deferribacteres present in the mammalian microbiota, to host protection against
      S. Tm colitis. Inhibition by M. schaedleri involves interference with S. Tm
      invasion gene expression, partly by competing for anaerobic electron acceptors.
      In conclusion, this study establishes M. schaedleri, a core member of the murine 
      gut microbiota, as a key antagonist of S. Tm virulence in the gut.

TI  - Bacterial and Fungal Endophytic Microbiomes of Salicornia europaea.
LID - e00305-19 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00305-19 [doi]
AB  - We examined Salicornia europaea, a nonmycorrhizal halophyte associated with
      specific and unique endophytic bacteria and fungi. The microbial community
      structure was analyzed at two sites differing in salinization history
      (anthropogenic and naturally saline site), in contrasting seasons (spring and
      fall) and in two plant organs (shoots and roots) via 16S rRNA and internal
      transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing. We observed distinct communities at the
      two sites, and in shoots and roots, while the season was of no importance. The
      bacterial community was less diverse in shoot libraries than in roots, regardless
      of the site and season, whereas no significant differences were observed for the 
      fungal community. Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated bacterial
      assemblages, and Ascomycetes were the most frequent fungi. A root core microbiome
      operational taxonomic unit belonging to the genus Marinimicrobium was identified.
      We detected a significant influence of the Salicornia bacterial community on the 
      fungal one by means of cocorrespondence analysis. In addition, pathways and
      potential functions of the bacterial community in Salicornia europaea were
      inferred and discussed. We can conclude that bacterial and fungal microbiomes of 
      S. europaea are determined by the origin of salinity at the sites. Bacterial
      communities seemed to influence fungal ones, but not the other way around, which 
      takes us closer to understanding of interactions between the two microbial
      groups. In addition, the plant organs of the halophyte filter the microbial
      community composition.IMPORTANCE Endophytes are particularly fascinating because 
      of their multifaceted lifestyle, i.e., they may exist as either free-living soil 
      microbes or saprobic ones or pathogens. Endophytic communities of halophytes may 
      be different than those in other plants because salinity acts as an environmental
      filter. At the same time, they may contribute to the host's adaptation to adverse
      environmental conditions, which may be of importance in agriculture.

AB  - Long-term agricultural fertilization strategies gradually change soil properties 
      including the associated microbial communities. Cultivated crops recruit
      beneficial microbes from the surrounding soil environment via root exudates. In
      this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of long-term fertilization
      strategies across field sites on the rhizosphere prokaryotic (Bacteria and
      Archaea) community composition and plant performance. We conducted growth chamber
      experiments with lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) cultivated in soils from two
      long-term field experiments, each of which compared organic versus mineral
      fertilization strategies. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing revealed the
      assemblage of a rhizosphere core microbiota shared in all lettuce plants across
      soils, going beyond differences in community composition depending on field site 
      and fertilization strategies. The enhanced expression of several plant genes with
      roles in oxidative and biotic stress signalling pathways in lettuce grown in
      soils with organic indicates an induced physiological status in plants. Lettuce
      plants grown in soils with different fertilization histories were visibly free of
      stress symptoms and achieved comparable biomass. This suggests a positive
      aboveground plant response to belowground plant-microbe interactions in the
      rhizosphere. Besides effects of fertilization strategy and field site, our
      results demonstrate the crucial role of the plant in driving rhizosphere
      microbiota assemblage.

AB  - Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) is widespread in the evolution of prokaryotes,
      especially those associated with the human body. Here, we implemented large-scale
      gene-species phylogenetic tree reconstructions and reconciliations to identify
      putative HGT-derived genes in the reference genomes of microbiota isolated from
      six major human body sites by the NIH Human Microbiome Project. Comparisons with 
      a control group representing microbial genomes from diverse natural environments 
      indicated that HGT activity increased significantly in the genomes of human
      microbiota, which is confirmatory of previous findings. Roughly, more than half
      of total genes in the genomes of human-associated microbiota were transferred
      (donated or received) by HGT. Up to 60% of the detected HGTs occurred either
      prior to the colonization of the human body or involved bacteria residing in
      different body sites. The latter could suggest 'genetic crosstalk' and movement
      of bacterial genes within the human body via hitherto poorly understood
      mechanisms. We also observed that HGT activity increased significantly among
      closely-related microorganisms and especially when they were united by physical
      proximity, suggesting that the 'phylogenetic effect' can significantly boost HGT 
      activity. Finally, we identified several core and widespread genes least
      influenced by HGT that could become useful markers for building robust 'trees of 
      life' and address several outstanding technical challenges to improve the
      phylogeny-based genome-wide HGT detection method for future applications.

TI  - Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the impact of the G2 enhancer, bead
      sizes and lysing tubes on the bacterial community composition during DNA
      extraction from recalcitrant soil core samples based on community sequencing and 
      qPCR.
PG  - e0200979
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0200979 [doi]
AB  - Soil DNA extraction encounters numerous challenges that can affect both yield and
      purity of the recovered DNA. Clay particles lead to reduced DNA extraction
      efficiency, and PCR inhibitors from the soil matrix can negatively affect
      downstream analyses when applying DNA sequencing. Further, these effects impede
      molecular analysis of bacterial community compositions in lower biomass samples, 
      as often observed in deeper soil layers. Many studies avoid these complications
      by using indirect DNA extraction with prior separation of the cells from the
      matrix, but such methods introduce other biases that influence the resulting
      microbial community composition. To address these issues, a direct DNA extraction
      method was applied in combination with the use of a commercial product, the G2
      DNA/RNA Enhancer, marketed as being capable of improving the amount of DNA
      recovered after the lysis step. The results showed that application of G2
      increased DNA yields from the studied clayey soils from layers from 1.00 to 2.20 
      m. Importantly, the use of G2 did not introduce bias, as it did not result in any
      significant differences in the biodiversity of the bacterial community measured
      in terms of alpha and beta diversity and taxonomical composition. Finally, this
      study considered a set of customised lysing tubes for evaluating possible
      influences on the DNA yield. Tubes customization included different bead sizes
      and amounts, along with lysing tubes coming from two suppliers. Results showed
      that the lysing tubes with mixed beads allowed greater DNA recovery compared to
      the use of either 0.1 or 1.4 mm beads, irrespective of the tube supplier. These
      outcomes may help to improve commercial products in DNA/RNA extraction kits,
      besides raising awareness about the optimal choice of additives, offering
      opportunities for acquiring a better understanding of topics such as vertical
      microbial characterisation and environmental DNA recovery in low biomass samples.

COIS- Carsten S. Jacobsen is a co-inventor of G2. His former employer, the Geological
      Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), issued the patent under Danish law
      (Improvement of lowbiomass soil DNA/RNA extraction yield and quality, European
      Patent Specification number EP 2 443 251 B1). GEUS later sold the patent to
      Ampliqon A/S (Odense, Denmark), which produces G2 today. The inventors receive a 
      percentage of the net sales of G2. Ampliqon A/S, the current owner of the G2
      patent, prepared and provided part of the laboratorial material used for this
      study. This does not alter our adherence to PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and

      and Niche Rather Than by Transgenic Events.

AB  - Microbial communities associated with plants represent key determinants of plant 
      health, survival, and growth. However, a good understanding of the structural
      composition of the bacterial and fungal microbiome present in different plant
      tissues and growing environments, especially in transgenic woody plants, is
      required. In the present study, we hypothesized that environmental conditions,
      ecological niches, and transgenic events could influence the community structure 
      of plant-associated microorganisms (bacterial and fungal endophytes). We sampled 
      the root and stem endospheres of field-grown transgenic and non-transgenic poplar
      trees (Populus alba x P. berolinensis) and applied 16S rRNA and internal
      transcribed spacer amplicon Illumina MiSeq sequencing to determine the bacterial 
      and fungal communities associated with the different plant habitats and tissues. 
      We found that actinobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, and firmicutes were 
      the dominant endophytic bacteria, and the fungal community was dominated by
      dothideomycetes, agaricomycetes, leotiomycetes, and sordariomycetes. In
      conclusion, transgenic events did not affect the endophytic bacterial and fungal 
      diversity of poplar trees. The bacterial and fungal community structure depends
      on the pH and the soil organic matter content. Each plant tissue represents a
      unique ecological niche for the microbial communities. Finally, we identified the
      indicator operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and core microbiome associated with 
      the different plant tissues of Populus and different environmental conditions.
      The results provide a basis for further study of host-microbial interactions with
      the identified abundant OTUs of Populus.

TI  - Characteristic dysbiosis of gut microbiota of Chinese patients with
      diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome by an insight into the
      pan-microbiome.
PG  - 889-904
LID - 10.1097/CM9.0000000000000192 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is reported associated with the
      alteration of gut microbial composition termed as dysbiosis. However, the
      pathogenic mechanism of IBS remains unclear, while the studies of Chinese
      individuals are scarce. This study aimed to understand the concept of dysbiosis
      among patients with Chinese diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D), as a degree of
      variance between the gut microbiomes of IBS-D population and that of a healthy
      population. METHODS: The patients with IBS-D were recruited (assessed according
      to the Rome III criteria, by IBS symptom severity score) from the Outpatient
      Department of Gastroenterology of Peking University Third Hospital, and
      volunteers as healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled, during 2013. The 16S rRNA
      sequences were extracted from fecal samples. Ribosomal database project
      resources, basic local alignment search tool, and SparCC software were used to
      obtain the phylotype composition of samples and the internal interactions of the 
      microbial community. Herein, the non-parametric test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test was 
      carried out to find the statistical significance between HC and IBS-D groups. All
      the P values were adjusted to q values to decrease the error rate. RESULTS: The
      study characterized the gut microbiomes of Chinese patients with IBS-D, and
      demonstrated that the dysbiosis could be characterized as directed alteration of 
      the microbiome composition leading to greater disparity between relative
      abundance of two phyla, Bacteroidetes (Z = 4.77, q = 1.59 x 10) and Firmicutes (Z
      = -3.87, q = 5.83 x 10). Moreover, it indicated that the IBS symptom features
      were associated with the dysbiosis of whole gut microbiome, instead of one or
      several certain genera even they were dominating. Two genera, Bacteroides and
      Lachnospiracea incertae sedis, were identified as the core genera, meanwhile, the
      non-core genera contribute to a larger pan-microbiome of the gut microbiome.
      Furthermore, the dysbiosis in patients with IBS-D was associated with a reduction
      of network complexity of the interacted microbial community (HC vs. IBS-D: 639
      vs. 154). The disordered metabolic functions of patients with IBS-D were
      identified as the potential influence of gut microbiome on the host (significant 
      difference with q < 0.01 between HC and IBS-D). CONCLUSIONS: This study supported
      the view of the potential influence of gut microbiome on the symptom of Chinese
      patients with IBS-D, and further characterized dysbiosis in Chinese patients with
      IBS-D, thus provided more pathological evidences for IBS-D with the further
      understanding of dysbiosis.

AB  - Biofloc technology is an efficient approach for intensive shrimp culture.
      However, the extent to which this process can influence the composition of
      intestinal microbial community is still unknown. Here, we surveyed the shrimp
      intestinal bacteria as well as the floc water from three biofloc systems with
      different stock densities. Our study revealed a similar variation trend in phylum
      taxonomy level between floc bacteria and gut microbiota. Microbial community
      varied notably in floc water from different stock densities, while a core genus
      with dominating relative abundance was detected in gut samples. Extensive
      variation was discovered in gut microbiota, but still clustered into groups
      according to stock density. Our results indicated that shrimp intestinal
      microbiota as well as bacteria aggregated in flocs assembled into distinct
      communities from different stock densities, and the intestinal communities were
      more similar with the surrounding environment as the increase of stock density
      and resulting high floc biomass. The high stock density changed the core gut
      microbiota by reducing the relative abundance of Paracoccus and increasing that
      of Nocardioides, which may negatively influence shrimp performance. Therefore,
      this study helps us to understand further bacteria and host interactions in
      biofloc system.

AB  - The effects of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) on reactor performance, extracellular
      polymeric substances composition and microbial community structure and function
      in integrated fixed-film activated sludge-sequencing batch reactors (IFAS-SBRs)
      were investigated. Results showed that the addition of AgNPs from 0.1 to 10mg/L
      exhibited no significant effects on nutrient removal. The average overall removal
      of COD, NH4(+)-N and PO4(3)(-)-P was 96.6%, 99.9% and 98.8%, respectively. The
      introduction of AgNPs caused an increase in extracellular polymeric substances
      content for the sludge and biofilm of IFAS-SBRs. The release of Ag(+) from AgNPs 
      and lactate dehydrogenase test implied the low toxicity of AgNPs to IFAS-SBRs.
      High-throughput sequencing revealed that microbial community structure showed
      significant shifts at phylum and genus levels after long-term exposure to AgNPs, 
      but core functional groups responsible for nutrient removal remained at high
      abundance. Bacterial function prediction indicated that the metabolic categories 
      showed no significant shifts under AgNPs stress, therefore good process
      performance could still be achieved.

AB  - An integrative multi-omics approach allowed monthly variations for a year of the 
      surface metabolome and the epibacterial community of the Mediterranean
      Phaeophyceae Taonia atomaria to be investigated. The LC-MS-based metabolomics and
      16S rDNA metabarcoding data sets were integrated in a multivariate meta-omics
      analysis (multi-block PLS-DA from the MixOmic DIABLO analysis) showing a strong
      seasonal covariation (Mantel test: p < 0.01). A network based on positive and
      negative correlations between the two data sets revealed two clusters of
      variables, one relative to the 'spring period' and a second to the 'summer
      period'. The 'spring period' cluster was mainly characterized by dipeptides
      positively correlated with a single bacterial taxon of the Alteromonadaceae
      family (BD1-7 clade). Moreover, 'summer' dominant epibacterial taxa from the
      second cluster (including Erythrobacteraceae, Rhodospirillaceae,
      Oceanospirillaceae and Flammeovirgaceae) showed positive correlations with few
      metabolites known as macroalgal antifouling defences [e.g.
      dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) and proline] which exhibited a key role within
      the correlation network. Despite a core community that represents a significant
      part of the total epibacteria, changes in the microbiota structure associated
      with surface metabolome variations suggested that both environment and algal host
      shape the bacterial surface microbiota.

      center.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/s40168-019-0672-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Viruses play an important role in ecosystems, including the built
      environment (BE). While numerous studies have characterized bacterial and fungal 
      microbiomes in the BE, few have focused on the viral microbiome (virome).
      Longitudinal microbiome studies provide insight into the stability and dynamics
      of microbial communities; however, few such studies exist for the microbiome of
      the BE, and most have focused on bacteria. Here, we present a longitudinal,
      metagenomic-based analysis of the airborne DNA and RNA virome of a children's
      daycare center. Specifically, we investigate how the airborne virome varies as a 
      function of season and human occupancy, and we identify possible sources of the
      viruses and their hosts, mainly humans, animals, plants, and insects. RESULTS:
      Season strongly influenced the airborne viral community composition, and a single
      sample collected when the daycare center was unoccupied suggested that occupancy 
      also influenced the community. The pattern of influence differed between DNA and 
      RNA viromes. Human-associated viruses were much more diverse and dominant in the 
      winter, while the summertime virome contained a high relative proportion and
      diversity of plant-associated viruses. CONCLUSIONS: This airborne microbiome in
      this building exhibited seasonality in its viral community but not its bacterial 
      community. Human occupancy influenced both types of communities. By adding new
      data about the viral microbiome to complement burgeoning information about the
      bacterial and fungal microbiomes, this study contributes to a more complete
      understanding of the airborne microbiome.

TI  - Spatial analysis of a hydrocarbon waste-remediating landfarm demonstrates
      influence of management practices on bacterial and fungal community structure.
PG  - 1199-1209
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.13397 [doi]
AB  - Cultivation of dedicated soil plots called 'landfarms' is an effective technology
      for bioremediation of hydrocarbon waste generated by various industrial
      practices. To understand the influence of soil conditions on landfarm microbial
      communities, analysis of bacterial and fungal community structure using
      next-generation sequencing at different sections and depths was performed across 
      a hydrocarbon-waste landfarm in Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada. While a core set of
      hydrocarbon-associated bacterial and fungal taxa are present throughout the
      landfarm, unique bacterial and fungal operational taxonomic units are
      differentially abundant at sections within the landfarm, which correlate with
      differences in soil physiochemical properties and management practices. Increased
      frequency of waste application resulted in strong positive correlations between
      bacterial community assemblages and elevated amounts of oil, grease and F3 - F4
      hydrocarbon fractions. In areas of standing water and lower application of
      hydrocarbon, microbial community structure correlated with soil pH, trace
      nutrients and metals. Overall, diversity and structure of bacterial communities
      remain relatively stable across the landfarm, while in contrast, fungal community
      structure appears more responsive to soil oxygen conditions. Results are
      consistent with the hypothesis that years of bioremediation activity have shaped 
      microbial communities; however, several management practices can be undertaken to
      increase efficiency of remediation, including the removal of standing water and
      soil tilling across the landfarm.

TI  - Structural equation modeling of a winnowed soil microbiome identifies how
      invasive plants re-structure microbial networks.
PG  - 1988-1996
LID - 10.1038/s41396-019-0407-y [doi]
AB  - The development of microbial networks is central to ecosystem functioning and is 
      the hallmark of complex natural systems. Characterizing network development over 
      time and across environmental gradients is hindered by the millions of potential 
      interactions among community members, limiting interpretations of network
      evolution. We developed a feature selection approach using data winnowing that
      identifies the most ecologically influential microorganisms within a network
      undergoing change. Using a combination of graph theory, leave-one-out analysis,
      and statistical inference, complex microbial communities are winnowed to identify
      the core organisms responding to external gradients or functionality, and then
      network development is evaluated against these externalities. In a plant invasion
      case study, the winnowed microbial network became more influential as the plant
      invasion progressed as a result of direct plant-microbe links rather than the
      expected indirect plant-soil-microbe links. This represents the first use of
      structural equation modeling to predict microbial network evolution, which
      requires identification of keystone taxa and quantification of the ecological
      processes underpinning community structure and function patterns.

TI  - Variability in the Composition of Pacific Oyster Microbiomes Across Oyster
      Families Exhibiting Different Levels of Susceptibility to OsHV-1 muvar Disease.

AB  - Oyster diseases are a major impediment to the profitability and growth of the
      oyster aquaculture industry. In recent years, geographically widespread outbreaks
      of disease caused by ostreid herpesvirus-1 microvariant (OsHV-1 muvar) have led
      to mass mortalities among Crassostrea gigas, the Pacific Oyster. Attempts to
      minimize the impact of this disease have been largely focused on breeding
      programs, and although these have shown some success in producing oyster families
      with reduced mortality, the mechanism(s) behind this protection is poorly
      understood. One possible factor is modification of the C. gigas microbiome. To
      explore how breeding for resistance to OsHV-1 muvar affects the oyster
      microbiome, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the bacterial
      communities associated with 35 C. gigas families, incorporating oysters with
      different levels of susceptibility to OsHV-1 muvar disease. The microbiomes of
      disease-susceptible families were significantly different to the microbiomes of
      disease-resistant families. OTUs assigned to the Photobacterium, Vibrio,
      Aliivibrio, Streptococcus, and Roseovarius genera were associated with low
      disease resistance. In partial support of this finding, qPCR identified a
      statistically significant increase of Vibrio-specific 16S rRNA gene copies in the
      low disease resistance families, possibly indicative of a reduced host immune
      response to these pathogens. In addition to these results, examination of the
      core microbiome revealed that each family possessed a small core community, with 
      OTUs assigned to the Winogradskyella genus and the Bradyrhizobiaceae family
      consistent members across most disease-resistant families. This study examines
      patterns in the microbiome of oyster families exhibiting differing levels of
      OsHV-1 muvar disease resistance and reveals some key bacterial taxa that may
      provide a protective or detrimental role in OsHV-1 muvar disease outbreaks.

AB  - It is now recognized that host microbiome, the community of microorganisms that
      colonize the animal body (e.g. microbiota) and their genomes, play an important
      role in the health status of all organisms, from nutrient processing to
      protection from disease. In particular, the complex, bilateral interactions
      between the host innate immune system and the microbiota are crucial in
      maintaining whole body homeostasis. The development of nanotechnology is raising 
      concern on the potential impact of nanoparticles-NPs on human and environmental
      health. Titanium dioxide-nTiO2, one of the most widely NP in use, has been shown 
      to affect the gut microbiota of mammals and fish, as well as to potentially alter
      microbial communities. In the marine bivalve Mytilus galloprovincialis, nTiO2 has
      been previously shown to interact with hemolymph components, thus resulting in
      immunomodulation. However, no information is available on the possible impact of 
      NPs on the microbiome of marine organisms. Bivalves host high microbial abundance
      and diversity, and alteration of their microbiota, in both tissues and hemolymph,
      in response to stressful conditions has been linked to a compromised health
      status and susceptibility to diseases. In this work, the effects of nTiO2
      exposure (100mug/L, 4days) on Mytilus hemolymph microbiota were investigated by
      16S rRNA gene-based profiling. Immune parameters were also evaluated. Although
      hemolymph microbiota of control and nTiO2-treated mussels revealed a similar core
      composition, nTiO2 exposure affected the abundance of different genera, with
      decreases in some (e.g. Shewanella, Kistimonas, Vibrio) and increases in others
      (e.g. Stenotrophomonas). The immunomodulatory effects of nTiO2 were confirmed by 
      the increase in the bactericidal activity of whole hemolymph. These represent the
      first data on the effects of NPs on the microbiome of marine invertebrates, and
      suggest that the shift in hemolymph microbiome composition induced by nTiO2 may
      result from the interplay between the microbiota and the immune system.

TI  - Ectomycorrhizal fungal communities are dominated by mammalian dispersed
      truffle-like taxa in north-east Australian woodlands.
PG  - 181-193
LID - 10.1007/s00572-019-00886-2 [doi]
AB  - Mycorrhizal fungi are very diverse, including those that produce truffle-like
      fruiting bodies. Truffle-like fungi are hypogeous and sequestrate (produced
      below-ground, with an enclosed hymenophore) and rely on animal consumption,
      mainly by mammals, for spore dispersal. This dependence links mycophagous mammals
      to mycorrhizal diversity and, assuming truffle-like fungi are important
      components of mycorrhizal communities, to plant nutrient cycling and ecosystem
      health. These links are largely untested as currently little is known about
      mycorrhizal fungal community structure and its dependence on mycophagous mammals.
      We quantified the mycorrhizal fungal community in the north-east Australian
      woodland, including the portion interacting with ten species of mycophagous
      mammals. The study area is core habitat of an endangered fungal specialist
      marsupial, Bettongia tropica, and as such provides baseline data on mycorrhizal
      fungi-mammal interactions in an area with no known mammal declines. We examined
      the mycorrhizal fungi in root and soil samples via high-throughput sequencing and
      compared the observed taxa to those dispersed by mycophagous mammals at the same 
      locations. We found that the dominant root-associating ectomycorrhizal fungal
      taxa (> 90% sequence abundance) included the truffle-like taxa Mesophellia,
      Hysterangium and Chondrogaster. These same taxa were also present in mycophagous 
      mammalian diets, with Mesophellia often dominating. Altogether, 88% of
      truffle-like taxa from root samples were shared with the fungal specialist diet
      and 52% with diets from generalist mammals. Our data suggest that changes in
      mammal communities, particularly the loss of fungal specialists, could, over
      time, induce reductions to truffle-like fungal diversity, causing ectomycorrhizal
      fungal communities to shift with unknown impacts on plant and ecosystem health.

AB  - Five mesophilic full-scale anaerobic digesters treating food waste (FW-digester),
      animal waste (AW-digester), and co-substrate of food waste and animal waste
      (CO-digesters) were monitored identify bacterial and archaeal communities and to 
      quantify the effect of substrate characteristics on them, and to identify 'core' 
      microorganism. The substrate characteristics and microbial communities of the
      FW-digester, AW-digester, and CO-digesters were statistically different. Organic 
      concentration and [Na(+)] were identified as major variations that effect
      microbial community. Methanogen community was more diverse in AW-digester than in
      FW-digester. Methanogen community in CO-digester was as diverse as in
      AW-digester, and the most dominant species was Methanoculleus bourgensis same as 
      in FW-digester. Twenty-one bacterial genera and four methanogen species were
      found in all digesters as a consequence of their metabolic versatility to degrade
      organic and inhibitor compounds. The results implied that these core
      microorganisms may contribute to maintaining a stable microbial ecosystem.

AB  - Ecological processes shaping the structure and diversity of microbial communities
      are of practical importance for managing the function and resilience of
      engineered biological ecosystems such as activated sludge processes. This study
      systematically evaluated the ecological processes acting during continuous
      exposure to a subinhibitory level of antimicrobial triclosan (TCS) as an
      environmental stressor. 16S rRNA gene-based community profiling revealed
      significant perturbations on the community structure and dramatic reduction (by
      20-30%) in species diversity/richness compared to those under the control
      conditions. In addition, community profiling determined the prevalence of the
      deterministic processes overwhelming the ecological stochasticity. Analysis of
      both community composition and phenotypes in the TCS-exposed communities
      suggested the detailed deterministic mechanism: selection of TCS degrading
      (Sphingopyxis) and resistant (Pseudoxanthomonas) bacterial populations. The
      analysis also revealed a significant reduction of core activated sludge members, 
      Chitinophagaceae (e.g., Ferruginibacter) and Comamonadaceae (e.g., Acidovorax),
      potentially affecting ecosystem functions (e.g., floc formation and nutrient
      removal) directly associated with system performance (i.e., wastewater treatment 
      efficiency and effluent quality). Overall, our study provides new findings that
      inform the mechanisms underlying the community structure and diversity of
      activated sludge, which not only advances the current understanding of microbial 
      ecology in activated sludge, but also has practical implications for the design
      and operation of environmental bioprocesses for treatment of
      antimicrobial-bearing waste streams.

      Nitrification Failure.

AB  - Wastewater treatment plants in temperate climate zones frequently undergo
      seasonal nitrification failure in the winter month yet maintain removal
      efficiency for other contaminants. We tested the hypothesis that nitrification
      failure can be correlated to shifts in the nitrifying microbial community. We
      monitored three parallel, full-scale sequencing batch reactors over the course of
      a year with respect to reactor performance, microbial community composition via
      16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and functional gene abundance using qPCR. All 
      reactors demonstrated similar changes to their core microbiome, and only subtle
      variations among seasonal and transient taxa. We observed a decrease in species
      richness during the winter, with a slow recovery of the activated sludge
      community during spring. Despite the change in nitrification performance, ammonia
      monooxygenase gene abundances remained constant throughout the year, as did the
      relative sequence abundance of Nitrosomonadacae. This suggests that nitrification
      failure at colder temperatures might result from different reaction kinetics of
      nitrifying taxa, or that other organisms with strong seasonal shifts in
      population abundance, e.g. an uncultured lineage of Saprospiraceae, affect plant 
      performance in the winter. This research is a comprehensive analysis of the
      seasonal microbial community dynamics in triplicate full-scale sequencing batch
      reactors and ultimately strengthens our basic understanding of the microbial
      ecology of activated sludge communities by revealing seasonal succession patterns
      of individual taxa that correlate with nutrient removal efficiency.

AB  - Northern populations of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) can be anadromous,
      migrating annually from the ocean to freshwater lakes and rivers in order to
      escape sub-zero temperatures. Such seasonal behavior demands that these fish and 
      their associated microbiomes adapt to changes in salinity, temperature, and other
      environmental challenges. We characterized the microbial community composition of
      anadromous S. alpinus, netted by Inuit fishermen at freshwater and seawater
      fishing sites in the high Arctic, both under ice and in open water. Bacterial
      profiles were generated by DNA extraction and high-throughput sequencing of
      PCR-amplified 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Results showed that microbial communities 
      on the skin and intestine of Arctic char were statistically different when
      sampled from freshwater or saline water sites. This association was tested using 
      hierarchical Ward's linkage clustering, showing eight distinct clusters in each
      of the skin and intestinal microbiomes, with the clusters reflecting sampling
      location between fresh and saline environments, confirming a salinity-linked
      turnover. This analysis also provided evidence for a core composition of skin and
      intestinal bacteria, with the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Cyanobacteria
      presenting as major phyla within the skin-associated microbiomes. The
      intestine-associated microbiome was characterized by unidentified genera from
      families Fusobacteriaceae, Comamonadaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Vibrionaceae.
      The salinity-linked turnover was further tested through ordinations that showed
      samples grouping based on environment for both skin- and intestine-associated
      microbiomes. This finding implies that core microbiomes between fresh and saline 
      conditions could be used to assist in regulating optimal fish health in
      aquaculture practices. Furthermore, identified taxa from known psychrophiles and 
      with nitrogen cycling properties suggest that there is additional potential for
      biotechnological applications for fish farm and waste management practices.

      primer pools.

AB  - Deep sequencing of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) gene amplicons
      continues to be the most common approach for characterization of complex
      microbial communities. PCR amplifications of conserved regions of SSU rRNA genes 
      often employ degenerate pools of primers to enable targeting of a broad spectrum 
      of organisms. One little noticed feature of such degenerate primer sets is the
      potential for a wide range of melting temperatures between the primer variants.
      The melting temperature variation of primers in a degenerate pool could lead to
      variable amplification efficiencies and PCR bias. Thus, we sought to adjust the
      melting temperature of each primer variant individually. Individual primer
      modifications were used to reduce theoretical melting temperature variation
      between primers, as well as to introduce inter-cluster nucleotide diversity
      during Illumina sequencing of primer regions. We demonstrate here the suitability
      of such primers for microbial community analysis. However, no substantial
      differences in microbial community structure were revealed when using primers
      with adjusted melting temperatures, though the optimal annealing temperature
      decreased.

TI  - A Multi-Kingdom Study Reveals the Plasticity of the Rumen Microbiota in Response 
      to a Shift From Non-grazing to Grazing Diets in Sheep.
PG  - 122
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2019.00122 [doi]
AB  - Increasing feed efficiency is a key target in ruminant science which requires a
      better understanding of rumen microbiota. This study investigated the effect of a
      shift from a non-grazing to a grazing diet on the rumen bacterial, methanogenic
      archaea, fungal, and protozoal communities. A systems biology approach based on a
      description of the community structure, core microbiota, network analysis, and
      taxon abundance linked to the rumen fermentation was used to explore the benefits
      of increasing depth of the community analysis. A total of 24 sheep were fed
      ryegrass hay supplemented with concentrate (CON) and subsequently ryegrass
      pasture (PAS) following a straight through experimental design. Results showed
      that concentrate supplementation in CON-fed animals (mainly starch) promoted a
      simplified rumen microbiota in terms of network density and bacterial, methanogen
      and fungal species richness which favored the proliferation of amylolytic
      microbes and VFA production (+48%), but led to a lower (ca. 4-fold) ammonia
      concentration making the N availability a limiting factor certain microbes. The
      adaptation process from the CON to the PAS diet consisted on an increase in the
      microbial concentration (biomass of bacteria, methanogens, and protozoa),
      diversity (+221, +3, and +21 OTUs for bacteria, methanogens, and fungi,
      respectively), microbial network complexity (+18 nodes and +86 edges) and in the 
      abundance of key microbes involved in cellulolysis (Ruminococcus, Butyrivibrio,
      and Orpinomyces), proteolysis (Prevotella and Entodiniinae), lactate production
      (Streptococcus and Selenomonas), as well as methylotrophic archaea
      (Methanomassiliicoccaceae). This microbial adaptation indicated that pasture
      degradation is a complex process which requires a diverse consortium of microbes 
      working together. The correlations between the abundance of microbial taxa and
      rumen fermentation parameters were not consistent across diets suggesting a
      metabolic plasticity which allowed microbes to adapt to different substrates and 
      to shift their fermentation products. The core microbiota was composed of 34, 9, 
      and 13 genera for bacteria, methanogens, and fungi, respectively, which were
      shared by all sheep, independent of diet. This systems biology approach adds a
      new dimension to our understanding of the rumen microbial interactions and may
      provide new clues to describe the mode of action of future nutritional
      interventions.

TI  - Construction of Synthetic Microbiota for Reproducible Flavor Compound Metabolism 
      in Chinese Light-Aroma-Type Liquor Produced by Solid-State Fermentation.
LID - e03090-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03090-18 [doi]
AB  - Natural microbiota plays an essential role in flavor compounds used in
      traditional food fermentation; however, the fluctuation in natural microbiota
      results in inconsistency in food quality. Thus, it is critical to reveal the core
      microbiota for flavor compound production and to construct a synthetic core
      microbiota for use in constant food fermentation. Here, we reveal the core
      microbiota based on their flavor production and cooccurrence performance, using
      Chinese light-aroma-type liquor as a model system. Five genera, Lactobacillus,
      Saccharomyces, Pichia, Geotrichum, and Candida, were identified to be the core
      microbiota. The synthetic core microbiota of these five genera presented a
      reproducible dynamic profile similar to that in the natural microbiota. A Monte
      Carlo test showed that the effects of five environmental factors (lactic acid,
      ethanol, and acetic acid contents, moisture, and pH) on the synthetic microbiota 
      distribution were highly significant (P < 0.01), similar to those effects on a
      natural fermentation system. In addition, 77.27% of the flavor compounds produced
      by the synthetic core microbiota showed a similar dynamic profile (rho > 0) with 
      that in the natural liquor fermentation process, and the flavor profile presented
      a similar composition. It indicated that the synthetic core microbiota is
      efficient for reproducible flavor metabolism. This work established a method for 
      identifying core microbiota and constructing a synthetic microbiota for
      reproducible flavor compounds. This work is of great significance for the
      tractable and constant production of various fermented foods.IMPORTANCE The
      transformation from natural fermentation to synthetic fermentation is essential
      in constructing a constant food fermentation process, which is the premise for
      stably making high-quality food. According to flavor-producing and cooccurring
      functions in dominant microbes, we provided a system-level approach to identify
      the core microbiota in Chinese light-aroma-type liquor fermentation. In addition,
      we successfully constructed a synthetic core microbiota to simulate the microbial
      community succession and flavor compound production in the in vitro system. The
      constructed synthetic core microbiota could not only facilitate a mechanistic
      understanding of the structure and function of the microbiota but also be
      beneficial for constructing a tractable and reproducible food fermentation
      process.

      microscopy, followed by characterization of the microbial community by culturing 
      or sequencing-based approaches. A sample, therefore, must be divided prior to
      analysis, often leading to inconsistent results. We demonstrate a combined
      approach, using scanning electron microscopy and next-generation shotgun
      sequencing, to visually identify a biofilm and characterize the microbial
      community, without dividing the sample. A clinical sample recovered from a
      patient following a dental root-filling procedure was prepared and visualized by 
      scanning electron microscopy. DNA was then extracted from the sample several
      years later and analyzed by shotgun sequencing. The method was subsequently
      validated on in vitro cultures of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm. Between 19 and 
      21 different genera and species were identified in the clinical sample with an
      estimated relative abundance greater than 1% by two different estimation
      approaches. Only eight genera identified were not associated with endodontic
      infections. This provides a proof-of-concept for a dual, microscopy and
      sequencing-based approach to identify and characterize bacterial biofilms, which 
      could also easily be implemented in other scientific fields.

TI  - Spring Water of an Alpine Karst Aquifer Is Dominated by a Taxonomically Stable
      but Discharge-Responsive Bacterial Community.

AB  - Alpine karst aquifers are important groundwater resources for the provision of
      drinking water all around the world. Yet, due to difficult accessibility and
      long-standing methodological limitations, the microbiology of these systems has
      long been understudied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the
      structure and dynamics of bacterial communities in spring water of an alpine
      limestone karst aquifer (LKAS2) under different hydrological conditions (base vs.
      event flow). The study was based on high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon
      sequencing, study design and sample selection were guided by hydrology and
      pollution microbiology data. Spanning more than 27 months, our analyses revealed 
      a taxonomically highly stable bacterial community, comprising high proportions of
      yet uncultivated bacteria in the suspended bacterial community fraction. Only the
      three candidate phyla Parcubacteria (OD1), Gracilibacteria (GN02), Doudnabacteria
      (SM2F11) together with Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes contributed between 70.0 
      and 88.4% of total reads throughout the investigation period. A core-community of
      300 OTUs consistently contributed between 37.6 and 56.3% of total reads, further 
      supporting the hypothesis of a high temporal stability in the bacterial community
      in the spring water. Nonetheless, a detectable response in the bacterial
      community structure of the spring water was discernible during a high-discharge
      event. Sequence reads affiliated to the class Flavobacteriia clearly increased
      from a mean proportion of 2.3% during baseflow to a maximum of 12.7% during the
      early phase of the studied high-discharge event, suggesting direct impacts from
      changing hydrological conditions on the bacterial community structure in the
      spring water. This was further supported by an increase in species richness
      (Chao1) at higher discharge. The combination of these observations allowed the
      identification and characterization of three different discharge classes (Q1-Q3).
      In conclusion, we found a taxonomically stable bacterial community prevailing in 
      spring waters from an alpine karst aquifer over the entire study period of more
      than 2 years. Clear response to changing discharge conditions could be detected
      for particular bacterial groups, whereas the most responsive group - bacteria
      affiliated to the class of Flavobacteriia - might harbor potential as a valuable 
      natural indicator of "system disturbances" in karst aquifers.

AB  - Defining the organisation of species interaction networks and unveiling the
      processes behind their assembly is fundamental to understanding patterns of
      biodiversity, community stability and ecosystem functioning. Marine sponges host 
      complex communities of microorganisms that contribute to their health and
      survival, yet the mechanisms behind microbiome assembly are largely unknown. We
      present the global marine sponge-microbiome network and reveal a modular
      organisation in both community structure and function. Modules are linked by a
      few sponge species that share microbes with other species around the world.
      Further, we provide evidence that abiotic factors influence the structuring of
      the sponge microbiome when considering all microbes present, but biotic
      interactions drive the assembly of more intimately associated 'core'
      microorganisms. These findings suggest that both ecological and evolutionary
      processes are at play in host-microbe network assembly. We expect mechanisms
      behind microbiome assembly to be consistent across multicellular hosts throughout
      the tree of life.

TI  - Bacterial Community of the Digestive Tract of the European Medicinal Leech
      (Hirudo verbana) from the Danube River.
PG  - 1082-1090
LID - 10.1007/s00248-019-01349-z [doi]
AB  - The digestive tract of medicinal leeches from commercial suppliers has been
      investigated previously and comprises of a relatively simple bacterial community.
      However, the microbiome of medicinal leeches collected directly from the natural 
      habitat has not been examined. In this study, we characterized the bacterial
      community in the digestive tract (anterior crop, posterior crop, and intestine)
      of the European medicinal leech, Hirudo verbana, collected from the Danube river 
      using culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches. Culture-independent
      approach confirmed that the digestive tract of H. verbana carries a relatively
      simple bacterial community with species richness in the individual samples
      ranging from 43 to164. The dominant bacterial taxon was Mucinivorans sp. (49.7%
      of total reads), followed by Aeromonas sp. (18.7% of total reads). Several low
      abundance taxa, new for H. verbana, such as Phreatobacter, Taibaiella,
      Fluviicola, Aquabacterium, Burkholderia, Hydrogenophaga, Wolinella, and
      unidentified Chitinophagia, were also detected. The aerobic culturing approach
      showed Aeromonas veronii (Proteobacteria), the known leech symbiont, as the most 
      dominant taxon followed by several Pseudomonas and Acidovorax spp. No significant
      differences in the bacterial community composition were detected among different 
      parts of the digestive tract of individual leeches. However, the overall
      composition of the bacterial community among individual specimen varied
      significantly and this is possibly due to differences in leech age, feeding
      status, and blood source. Our results showed that the core bacterial community of
      H. verbana collected from the natural habitat is similar to that reported from
      the digestive tract of commercially supplied leeches maintained in the
      laboratory.

TI  - Diverse microbial communities hosted by the model carnivorous pitcher plant
      Sarracenia purpurea: analysis of both bacterial and eukaryotic composition across
      distinct host plant populations.
PG  - e6392
LID - 10.7717/peerj.6392 [doi]
AB  - Background: The pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea supplements nutrient
      acquisition through carnivory, capturing insect prey which are digested by a food
      web community of eukaryotes and bacteria. While the food web invertebrates are
      well studied, and some recent studies have characterized bacteria, detailed
      genetic analysis of eukaryotic diversity is lacking. This study aimed to compare 
      eukaryotic and bacterial composition and diversity of pitcher communities within 
      and between populations of host plants in nearby but distinct wetland habitats,
      and to characterize microbial functions across populations and in comparison with
      another freshwater community. Methods: Pitcher fluid was sampled from the two
      wetlands, Cedarburg and Sapa Bogs, community DNA was extracted, and 16S and 18S
      rRNA amplicons were sequenced and data processed for community-level comparisons.
      Results and Conclusions: Bacterial diversity in the small pitcher volume rivaled 
      that of larger aquatic communities. Between pitcher plant populations, several
      bacterial families (Kiloniellaceae, Acetobacteraceae, Xanthobacteraceae,
      Sanguibacteraceae, Oligoflexaceae, Nitrosomonadaceae, Chromatiaceae,
      Saprospiraceae) were significantly higher in one population. However, although
      predicted pitcher bacterial functions were distinct from other freshwater
      communities, especially for some amino acid metabolism, functions were similar
      across all the pitchers in the two populations. This suggests some functional
      redundancy among bacterial taxa, and that functions converge to achieve similar
      food web processes. The sequencing identified a previously under-appreciated high
      diversity of ciliates, Acari mites, fungi and flagellates in pitcher communities;
      the most abundant sequences from eukaryotic taxa were Oligohymenophorea ciliates,
      millipedes and Ichthyosporea flagellates. Two thirds of taxa were identified as
      food web inhabitants and less than one third as prey organisms. Although
      eukaryotic composition was not significantly different between populations, there
      were different species of core taxonomic groups present in different
      pitchers-these differences may be driven by wetland habitats providing different 
      populations to colonize new pitchers. Eukaryotic composition was more variable
      than bacterial composition, and there was a poor relationship between bacterial
      and eukaryotic composition within individual pitchers, suggesting that
      colonization by eukaryotes may be more stochastic than for bacteria, and
      bacterial recruitment to pitchers may involve factors other than prey capture and
      colonization by eukaryotic food web inhabitants.

AB  - Microbial communities in wetland soils play vital roles in biogeochemical cycling
      of nutrients. In this study, the soil samples were collected from Suaeda, reed
      and Suaeda-reed hybrid zones in Shuangtaizi River Estuary, Northeast China, and
      the rhizosphere bacterial communities were compared using Illumina MiSeq
      sequencing. The microbial richness, diversity and structure of bacterial
      communities varied greatly in reed and Suaeda. Canonical correspondence analysis 
      and Mantel test indicated that pH was the most significant factor (P<0.05) in
      bacterial community assembly. Proteobacteria was the most dominant phylum,
      accounting for 45.7-58.0% of the total sequences. Thioprofundum, Thiohalomonas
      and Exiguobacterium were the predominant genera in Suaeda, while Exiguobacterium,
      Gillisia, Desulfomonile, Citrobacter, Thioprofundum and Acinetobacter were the
      core species in reed. PICRUSt analysis revealed similar functional profiles of
      rhizosphere microbiota in reed and Suaeda. Nitrate reduction related genes were
      abundant for nitrogen metabolism, whereas assimilatory sulfate reduction was the 
      major process for sulfur metabolism.

AB  - Gut microbiota affects health, metabolism and immunity of the host, and in the
      case of livestock, also food-safety. Here, 16S rRNA gene high-throughput Illumina
      sequencing was used to describe the microbiome of chicken caeca in two different 
      breeds and management systems throughout their whole productive lifespan.
      Broilers (Ross-308), as a fast-growing breed reared in an intensive system for
      42-days, and a slow-growing breed of chicken (Sasso-T451A) reared in an extensive
      farming system with outdoor access for 86-days, were compared. The core
      microbiome and differentially abundant taxa, as well as taxa associated with age 
      were identified. Age was identified as the strongest influencing factor in caecal
      microbiota composition, and, in general, each age-group showed an age-associated 
      community profile, with a transition period at the middle of their lifespan.
      However, substantial differences were observed in the composition of caecal
      microbiota of both chicken breeds, microbiota being richer and more complex in
      free-range chicken than in broilers. Several taxa positively/negatively
      correlated with Campylobacter relative abundance were also identified. Especially
      noteworthy was the identification by microbial community comparison of microbiota
      profiles suggestive of dysbiosis in several free-range chickens, probably
      associated to the typhlitis observed in the lumen of their caeca.

      coalbeds through ~1000 days anaerobic bioreactor cultivation.
PG  - 2305

AB  - Recent explorations of scientific ocean drilling have revealed the presence of
      microbial communities persisting in sediments down to ~2.5 km below the ocean
      floor. However, our knowledge of these microbial populations in the deep
      subseafloor sedimentary biosphere remains limited. Here, we present a cultivation
      experiment of 2-km-deep subseafloor microbial communities in 20-million-year-old 
      lignite coalbeds using a continuous-flow bioreactor operating at 40 degrees C for
      1029 days with lignite particles as the major energy source. Chemical monitoring 
      of effluent samples via fluorescence emission-excitation matrices spectroscopy
      and stable isotope analyses traced the transformation of coalbed-derived organic 
      matter in the dissolved phase. Hereby, the production of acetate and
      (13)C-depleted methane together with the increase and transformation of high
      molecular weight humics point to an active lignite-degrading methanogenic
      community present within the bioreactor. Electron microscopy revealed abundant
      microbial cells growing on the surface of lignite particles. Small subunit rRNA
      gene sequence analysis revealed that diverse microorganisms grew in the
      bioreactor (e.g., phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, 
      Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, Tenericutes, Ignavibacteriae, and SBR1093). These
      results indicate that activation and adaptive growth of 2-km-deep microbes was
      successfully accomplished using a continuous-flow bioreactor, which lays the
      groundwork to explore networks of microbial communities of the deep biosphere and
      their physiologies.

AB  - Microbial communities control numerous biogeochemical processes critical for
      ecosystem function and health. Most analyses of coastal microbial communities
      focus on the characterization of bacteria present in either sediment or seawater,
      with fewer studies characterizing both sediment and seawater together at a given 
      site, and even fewer studies including information about non-bacterial microbial 
      communities. As a result, knowledge about the ecological patterns of microbial
      biodiversity across domains and habitats in coastal communities is
      limited-despite the fact that archaea, bacteria, and microbial eukaryotes are
      present and known to interact in coastal habitats. To better understand microbial
      biodiversity patterns in coastal ecosystems, we characterized sediment and
      seawater microbial communities for three sites along the coastline of Puerto
      Nuevo, Baja California, Mexico using both 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon
      sequencing. We found that sediment hosted approximately 500-fold more operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) for bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes than
      seawater (p < 0.001). Distinct phyla were found in sediment versus seawater
      samples. Of the top ten most abundant classes, Cytophagia (bacterial) and
      Chromadorea (eukaryal) were specific to the sediment environment, whereas
      Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidia (bacterial) and Chlorophyceae (eukaryal) were
      specific to the seawater environment. A total of 47 unique genera were observed
      to comprise the core taxa community across environment types and sites. No
      archaeal taxa were observed as part of either the abundant or core taxa. No
      significant differences were observed for sediment community composition across
      domains or between sites. For seawater, the bacterial and archaeal community
      composition was statistically different for the Major Outlet site (p < 0.05), the
      site closest to a residential area, and the eukaryal community composition was
      statistically different between all sites (p < 0.05). Our findings highlight the 
      distinct patterns and spatial heterogeneity in microbial communities of a coastal
      region in Baja California, Mexico.

AB  - Successful in situ phytoremediation depends on beneficial interactions between
      roots and microbes. However, the assembly strategies of root-associated
      microbiome during phytoremediation are not well known. Here we investigated the
      assembly patterns of root-associated microbiomes during phytoremediation as well 
      as its regulation by both plants and heavy metals. Plant cultivation and soil
      amendment increased microbial diversity and restructured microbial communities.
      Rhizo-compartmentalization was the largest source of variation in root-associated
      microbiomes, with endosphere being the most independent and exclusive
      compartment. Soil type explained a larger amount of microbiomes variation in bulk
      soil and rhizosphere than that in endosphere. A specific core root microbiome was
      likely to be selected by the metal-tolerant plant H. cannabinus, with
      Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Comamonadaceae which contain a large
      number of metal-tolerant and plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) being the
      most abundant families. The root-associated microbial community tended to proceed
      a niche-assembled patterns and formed a smaller bacterial pool dominant by
      Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi under metal-contaminated
      conditions. Among these genera, potential metal-tolerant PGPB species have taken 
      up the keystone positions in the microbial co-occurrence networks, revealing
      their key roles in metal-contaminated environment due to niche selection. We also
      detected a keystone functional group reducing metal bioavailability which might
      work as vanguards and devote to maintaining the structure and function of the
      whole microbial community. In conclusion, this study suggested a specific
      assembly pattern of root-associated microbiomes of the metal-tolerant plant H.
      cannabinus during phytoremediation, showing the directional selections of the
      associated microbiomes by both the plant and metal-contaminated conditions in
      such a system.

AB  - China's population accounts for about 1/5(th) of the world's total population.
      Owing to differences in environment, race, living habits, and other factors, the 
      structure of the intestinal flora of Chinese individuals is expected to have
      unique features; however, this has not been thoroughly examined. Here, we
      collected faecal samples from healthy adults living in three cities of China and 
      investigated their gut microbiome using metagenomics and bioinformatics
      technology. We found that 11 core bacterial genera were present in all of the
      Chinese faecal samples; moreover, several patient characteristics (age, region,
      body mass index, physical exercise, smoking habits, and alcoholic drink, and
      yogurt consumption) were found to have different effects on the gut microbiome of
      healthy Chinese people. We also examined the distribution patterns of
      disease-related microorganisms (DRMs), revealing which DRMs can potentially be
      used as markers for assessment of health risk. We also developed a program called
      "Guthealthy" for evaluating the health status associated with the microbiome and 
      DRM pattern in the faecal samples. The microbiota data obtained in this study
      will provide a basis for a healthy gut microbiome composition in the Chinese
      population.

TI  - The Effect of Density-Dependent Phase on the Locust Gut Bacterial Composition.
PG  - 3020
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.03020 [doi]
AB  - The desert locust demonstrates density-dependent phase polyphenism: For extended 
      periods it appears in a non-aggregating, non-migrating phenotype, known as the
      solitary phase. When circumstances change, solitary individuals may aggregate and
      transform to the gregarious phenotype, which have a strong propensity for
      generating large swarms. Previous reports have suggested a role for gut-bacteria 
      derived volatiles in the swarming phenomenon, and suggested that locusts are
      capable of manipulating their gut microbiome according to their density-dependent
      phases. Here, we directly tested this hypothesis for the first time. Using
      locusts of both phases from well-controlled laboratory cultures as well as
      gregarious field-collected individuals; and high-throughput sequencing. We
      characterized the hindgut bacterial community composition in the two phases of
      the desert locust. Our findings demonstrate that laboratory-reared gregarious and
      solitary locusts maintain a stable core of Enterobacter. However, while different
      generations of gregarious locust experience shifts in their Enterobacter's
      relative abundance; the solitary locusts maintain a stable gut microbiome, highly
      similar to that of the field-collected locusts. Tentative phase differences in
      wild populations' microbiome may thus be an indirect effect of environmental or
      other factors that push the swarming individuals to homogenous gut bacteria. We
      therefore conclude that there are phase-related differences in the population
      dynamics of the locust hindgut bacterial composition, but there is no intrinsic
      density-dependent mechanism directly affecting the gut microbiome.

PG  - 575-588
LID - 10.1007/s00248-019-01331-9 [doi]
AB  - Water hyacinth (WH), a large floating plant, plays an important role in the
      biogeochemistry and ecology of many freshwaters globally. Its biogeochemical
      impact on wetland functioning is strongly mediated by the microbiome associated
      with its roots. However, little is known about the structure and function of this
      WH rhizobiome and its relation to wetland ecosystem functioning. Here, we unveil 
      the core and transient rhizobiomes of WH and their key biogeochemical functions
      in two of the world's largest wetlands: the Amazon and the Pantanal. WH hosts a
      highly diverse microbial community shaped by spatiotemporal changes.
      Proteobacteria lineages were most common, followed by Actinobacteria and
      Planctomycetes. Deltaproteobacteria and Sphingobacteriia predominated in the core
      microbiome, potentially associated with polysaccharide degradation and
      fermentation of plant-derived carbon. Conversely, a plethora of lineages were
      transient, including highly abundant Acinetobacter, Acidobacteria subgroup 6, and
      methanotrophs, thus assuring diverse taxonomic signatures in the two different
      wetlands. Our findings point out that methanogenesis is a key driver of, and
      proxy for, community structure, especially during seasonal plant decline. We
      provide ecologically relevant insights into the WH microbiome, which is a key
      element linking plant-associated carbon turnover with other biogeochemical fluxes
      in tropical wetlands.

      (e.g., the gut) by dynamic communities of microorganisms is now universally
      accepted, the existence of microbial populations in other "classically sterile"
      locations, including the blood, is a relatively new concept. The presence of
      bacteria-specific DNA in the blood has been reported in the literature for some
      time, yet the true origin of this is still the subject of much deliberation. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the phenomenon of a "blood microbiome" by
      providing a comprehensive description of bacterially derived nucleic acids using 
      a range of complementary molecular and classical microbiological techniques. For 
      this purpose we utilized a set of plasma samples from healthy subjects (n = 5)
      and asthmatic subjects (n = 5). DNA-level analyses involved the amplification and
      sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. RNA-level analyses were based upon the de novo
      assembly of unmapped mRNA reads and subsequent taxonomic identification.
      Molecular studies were complemented by viability data from classical aerobic and 
      anaerobic microbial culture experiments. At the phylum level, the blood
      microbiome was predominated by Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and
      Bacteroidetes. The key phyla detected were consistent irrespective of molecular
      method (DNA vs. RNA), and consistent with the results of other published studies.
      In silico comparison of our data with that of the Human Microbiome Project
      revealed that members of the blood microbiome were most likely to have originated
      from the oral or skin communities. To our surprise, aerobic and anaerobic
      cultures were positive in eight of out the ten donor samples investigated, and we
      reflect upon their source. Our data provide further evidence of a core blood
      microbiome, and provide insight into the potential source of the bacterial
      DNA/RNA detected in the blood. Further, data reveal the importance of robust
      experimental procedures, and identify areas for future consideration.

AB  - To better understand the effects of bacteria on the characteristics of Fu brick
      tea, we investigated bacterial community structure as well as the predicted
      functions of identified bacteria and their correlations with chemical compounds
      during the manufacturing process. Overall, Klebsiella species dominated during
      the initial stage of processing, but were quickly replaced by Pseudomonas,
      Lactococcus, Stenotrophomonas, Enterococcus, and Bacillus species, which remained
      stable until the end of the manufacturing process. Network analysis identified 11
      bacterial genera as keystone taxa, which contributed to the stabilization of the 
      microbial community in the co-occurrence network. Bacterial taxa were grouped
      into eight modules, with the dominant genera mainly distributed amongst modules I
      and , which were involved in metabolism of carbon and flavor compounds in the Fu 
      brick tea ecosystem. Using bidirectional orthogonal partial least squares
      analysis, 19 bacterial genera were identified as core functional genera linked to
      the metabolism of chemical compounds during the manufacturing process, while
      three genera, namely Klebsiella, Lactococcus, and Bacillus, also dominated the Fu
      brick tea fermentation process. These findings provide new insights into Fu Brick
      tea bacterial community variation and increased our understanding of the core
      functional bacterial genera involved in the manufacture of Fu brick tea.

AB  - Obtaining efficient antibiotic-mineralizing consortium or pure cultures is a
      central issue for the deep elimination of antibiotic-contaminated environments.
      However, the antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) mineralizing consortium has not yet
      been reported. In this study, an efficient CAP-mineralizing consortium was
      successfully obtained with municipal activated sludge as the initial inoculum.
      This consortium is capable of aerobically subsisting on CAP as the sole carbon,
      nitrogen and energy sources and completely degrading 50mgL(-1) CAP within 24h.
      After 5d, 71.50+/-2.63% of CAP was mineralized and Cl(-) recovery efficiency was 
      90.80+/-7.34%. Interestingly, the CAP degradation efficiency obviously decreased 
      to 18.22+/-3.52% within 12h with co-metabolic carbon source glucose.
      p-nitrobenzoic acid (p-NBA) was identified as an intermediate product during CAP 
      biodegradation. The consortium is also able to utilize p-NBA as the sole carbon
      and nitrogen sources and almost completely degrade 25mgL(-1)p-NBA within 24h.
      Microbial community analysis indicated that the dominant genera in the
      CAP-mineralizing consortium all belong to Proteobacteria (especially Sphingobium 
      with the relative abundance over 63%), and most bacteria could degrade aromatics 
      including p-NBA, suggesting these genera involved in the upstream and downstream 
      pathway of CAP degradation. Although the acclimated consortium has been
      successively passaged 152 times, the microbial community structure and core
      genera were not obviously changed, which was consistent with the stable CAP
      degradation efficiency observed under different generations. This is the first
      report that the acclimated consortium is able to mineralize CAP through an
      oxidative pathway with p-NBA as an intermediate product.

AB  - Feedstock type influences bacterial and methanogenic communities in anaerobic
      digestion. These two communities work tightly to maintain the stability of
      anaerobic digestion. How to quick report the changes of microbial community
      structure especially methanogenesis is the key issue for optimizing anaerobic
      digestion process. In this study, (13)C isotope fractionations of CH4 and CO2 in 
      biogas and microbial community composition were analyzed in 5 different
      feedstocks. Our results showed that grass silage, maize silage and swine manure
      fed reactors had similar delta (13)C values and methanogenic community
      composition, dominated by Methanosarcinaceae. The lowest delta (13)CH4 values
      were detected in straw and chicken manure fed reactors, reflecting reduced
      microbial degradation of material or the presence of toxic components in these
      feedstocks. The straw fed bioreactor lead to low delta (13)CH4 values, probably
      reflecting relatively high levels of the syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria,
      Synergistaceae and Syntrophaceae, which might work collectively with
      hydrogenotrophic methanogens, resulting in the low delta (13)CH4 values in this
      bioreactor. Significantly, all core microbes in the 5 different feedstock fed
      bioreactors were either Clostridia species or related to the Synergistaceae
      (syntrophic acetate oxidizing bacteria).

AB  - Traditional food products are important to our culture and heritage, and to the
      continued success of the food industry. Many of the production processes
      associated with these products have not been subjected to an in-depth microbial
      compositional analysis. The traditional process of curing meat, both preserves a 
      natural protein source, as well as increasing its organoleptic qualities. One of 
      the most important salting processes is known as Wiltshire curing. The Wiltshire 
      process involves injecting pork with a curing solution and immersing the meat
      into microbial-rich brine which promotes the development of the distinct
      organoleptic characteristics. The important microbial component of Wiltshire
      brine has not been extensively characterized. We analyzed the key microbial
      component of Wiltshire brine by performing microbiome analysis using Next
      Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies. This analysis identified the genera,
      Marinilactibacillus, Carnobacterium, Leuconostoc, and Vibrio as the core
      microflora present in Wiltshire curing brine. The important food industrial
      applications of these bacteria were also assessed. The bacterial diversity of the
      brine was investigated, and the community composition of the brine was
      demonstrated to change over time. New knowledge on the characterization of key
      microbiota associated with a productive Wiltshire brine is an important
      development linked to promoting enhanced quality and safety of meat processing in
      the food industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Water springs provide important ecosystem services including drinking
      water supply, recreation, and balneotherapy, but their microbial communities
      remain largely unknown. In this study, we characterized the spring water
      microbiome of Comano Terme (Italy) at four sampling points of the thermal spa,
      including natural (spring and well) and human-built (storage tank, bathtubs)
      environments. We integrated large-scale culturing and metagenomic approaches,
      with the aim of comprehensively determining the spring water taxonomic
      composition and functional potential. RESULTS: The groundwater feeding the spring
      hosted the most atypical microbiome, including many taxa known to be recalcitrant
      to cultivation. The core microbiome included the orders Sphingomonadales,
      Rhizobiales, and Caulobacterales, and the families Bradyrhizobiaceae and
      Moraxellaceae. A comparative genomic analysis of 72 isolates and 30
      metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) revealed that most isolates and MAGs belonged
      to new species or higher taxonomic ranks widely distributed in the microbial tree
      of life. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) values calculated for each isolated or
      assembled genome showed that 10 genomes belonged to known bacterial species (>
      95% ANI), 36 genomes (including 1 MAG) had ANI values ranging 85-92.5% and could 
      be assigned as undescribed species belonging to known genera, while the remaining
      55 genomes had lower ANI values (< 85%). A number of functional features were
      significantly over- or underrepresented in genomes derived from the four sampling
      sites. Functional specialization was found between sites, with for example
      methanogenesis being unique to groundwater whereas methanotrophy was found in all
      samples. CONCLUSIONS: Current knowledge on aquatic microbiomes is essentially
      based on surface or human-associated environments. We started uncovering the
      spring water microbiome, highlighting an unexpected diversity that should be
      further investigated. This study confirms that groundwater environments host
      highly adapted, stable microbial communities composed of many unknown taxa, even 
      among the culturable fraction.

      brackish and marine waters.

AB  - Phytoplankton and bacteria interactions have a significant role in aquatic
      ecosystem functioning. Associations can range from mutualistic to parasitic,
      shaping biogeochemical cycles and having a direct influence on phytoplankton
      growth. How variations in phenotype and sampling location, affect the
      phytoplankton microbiome is largely unknown. A high-resolution characterization
      of the bacterial community in cultures of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium was
      performed on strains isolated from different geographical locations and at
      varying anthropogenic impact levels. Microbiomes of Baltic Sea Alexandrium
      ostenfeldii isolates were dominated by Betaproteobacteria and were consistent
      over phenotypic and genotypic Alexandrium strain variation, resulting in
      identification of an A. ostenfeldii core microbiome. Comparisons with in situ
      bacterial communities showed that taxa found in this A. ostenfeldii core were
      specifically associated to dinoflagellate dynamics in the Baltic Sea. Microbiomes
      of Alexandrium tamarense and minutum, isolated from the Mediterranean Sea,
      differed from those of A. ostenfeldii in bacterial diversity and composition but 
      displayed high consistency, and a core set of bacterial taxa was identified. This
      indicates that Alexandrium isolates with diverse phenotypes host predictable,
      species-specific, core microbiomes reflecting the abiotic conditions from which
      they were isolated. These findings enable in-depth studies of potential
      interactions occurring between Alexandrium and specific bacterial taxa.

TI  - Physical Inaccessibility of a Resistant Starch Shifts Mouse Gut Microbiota to
      Butyrogenic Firmicutes.
PG  - e1801012
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201801012 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Resistant starch (RS) is utilized by Gram-negative Bacteroidetes through a
      starch utilization system (Sus), which requires physical attachment of the
      bacteria to the substrate. Gram-positive Firmicutes, which include butyrate
      producers, utilize RS by other mechanisms, such as amylosomes and secreted
      amylases/glucoamylases. It has been previously shown that fabricated RS
      [alginate-based starch-entrapped microspheres (SM)] increases butyrate in in
      vitro human fecal fermentation and was slow fermenting. It has been hypothesized 
      that in vivo SM would disfavor Bacteroidetes and promote Firmicutes, leading to
      an increase in butyrate production. METHODS AND RESULTS: A C57BL/6J mouse model
      is used to test type 2 RS (RS2, raw potato) and SM for SCFAs and fecal microbial 
      community structure. Feeding SM for 2 weeks results in 2.4 times higher mol%
      butyrate in the mouse distal gut than RS2. SM reduces relative abundance of
      Bacteroidetes and increases Firmicutes in fecal samples at the end of the 2-week 
      feeding. This phylum-level taxonomic shift is not observed in animals fed RS2.
      CONCLUSION: Through an approach to understand bacterial requirements related to
      starch utilization, a designed fiber type favors butyrogenic Firmicutes bacteria 
      and provides higher mol% butyrate in the distal gut with potential benefit as an 
      anti-inflammatory agent and to improve gut barrier function.

TI  - Antibiotics-induced monodominance of a novel gut bacterial order.
PG  - 1781-1790
LID - 10.1136/gutjnl-2018-317715 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The composition of the healthy human adult gut microbiome is
      relatively stable over prolonged periods, and representatives of the most highly 
      abundant and prevalent species have been cultured and described. However,
      microbial abundances can change on perturbations, such as antibiotics intake,
      enabling the identification and characterisation of otherwise low abundant
      species. DESIGN: Analysing gut microbial time-series data, we used shotgun
      metagenomics to create strain level taxonomic and functional profiles. Community 
      dynamics were modelled postintervention with a focus on conditionally rare taxa
      and previously unknown bacteria. RESULTS: In response to a commonly prescribed
      cephalosporin (ceftriaxone), we observe a strong compositional shift in one
      subject, in which a previously unknown species, (U) Borkfalki ceftriaxensis, was 
      identified, blooming to 92% relative abundance. The genome assembly reveals that 
      this species (1) belongs to a so far undescribed order of Firmicutes, (2) is
      ubiquitously present at low abundances in at least one third of adults, (3) is
      opportunistically growing, being ecologically similar to typical probiotic
      species and (4) is stably associated to healthy hosts as determined by single
      nucleotide variation analysis. It was the first coloniser after the antibiotic
      intervention that led to a long-lasting microbial community shift and likely
      permanent loss of nine commensals. CONCLUSION: The bloom of (U) B. ceftriaxensis 
      and a subsequent one of Parabacteroides distasonis demonstrate the existence of
      monodominance community states in the gut. Our study points to an undiscovered
      wealth of low abundant but common taxa in the human gut and calls for more highly
      resolved longitudinal studies, in particular on ecosystem perturbations.

AB  - Grassland afforestation dramatically affects the abiotic, biotic, and ecological 
      function properties of the original ecosystems. Interference from afforestation
      might disrupt the stasis of soil physicochemical properties and the dynamic
      balance of microbiota. Some studies have suggested low sensitivity of soil
      properties and bacterial community to afforestation, but the apparent lack of a
      significant relationship is probably due to the confounding effects of the
      generalist habitat and rare bacterial communities. In this study, soil chemical
      and prokaryotic properties in a 30-year-old Mongolia pine (Pinus sylvestris var. 
      mongolica Litv.) afforested region and adjacent grassland in Inner Mongolia were 
      classified and quantified. Our results indicate that the high richness of rare
      microbes accounts for the alpha-diversity of the soil microbiome. Few OTUs of
      generalist (core bacteria) and habitat-specialist bacteria are present. However, 
      the high abundance of this small number of OTUs governs the beta-diversity of the
      grassland and afforested land bacterial communities. Afforestation has changed
      the soil chemical properties, thus indirectly affecting the soil bacterial
      composition rather than richness. The contents of soil P, Ca(2+), and Fe(3+)
      account for differentially abundant OTUs such as Planctomycetes and subsequent
      changes in the ecologically functional potential of soil bacterial communities
      due to grassland afforestation. We conclude that grassland afforestation has
      changed the chemical properties and composition of the soil and ecological
      functions of the soil bacterial community and that these effects of afforestation
      on the microbiome have been modulated by changes in soil chemical properties.

TI  - The microbiomic and environmental analysis of sediments in the Indo-Pacific
      humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) habitat in the Northern Beibu Gulf, China.
PG  - 6957-6970

AB  - The northern Beibu Gulf is one of the major habitats for the Indo-Pacific
      humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis) in China. In this habitat, the core
      distribution zone of humpback dolphins was confined to the Sanniang Bay (SNB) and
      Dafengjiang River Estuary (DRE) areas. In our present research, the sediments of 
      14 sampling sites across the SNB and DRE waters were collected and further
      conducted for microbiomic and environmental analysis to explore the ecosystem
      characteristics of major humpback dolphin habitats in Northern Beibu Gulf. The
      environmental condition includes ammonia nitrogen (NH4(+)-N), nitrate nitrogen
      (NO3(-)-N), dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), sulfur content in the form of
      sulfuric acid (SO4(2-)-S), Fe, and heavy metals (including Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, and
      As). The composition of the bacterial community was characterized by 16S
      ribosomal DNA analysis of the V3-V4 regions using the Illumina-based sequencing
      platform. The environmental characteristic of the nutrient elements and heavy
      metals indicated that SNB suffered more anthropogenic impact than DRE. The
      comparably higher concentration of NH4(+)-N, NO3(-)-N, DRP, Pb, and Cd in the SNB
      region was detected. The comparably higher nutrients in the SNB may have resulted
      in higher biomass and lower dissolved oxygen (DO) profile, which was further
      proved by Landsat thermal image data. The microbiome analysis showed that the DRE
      region was oligotrophic and SNB reflected an anaerobic environment in the
      sediments. Environmental factors rather than the spatial distance determined the 
      similarity of bacterial community among different sites. Ecological associations 
      between environmental, oceanographic, and bacterial characteristics were
      illustrated, which exhibited strong mutual associations. Our findings presented a
      feasibility that integrates empirical and remote sensing data to distinguish
      ecological features and evaluate ecosystem healthiness for the humpback dolphin
      habitats.

AB  - Compared to drinking water, the higher bacterial abundance, diversity, and
      organic matter concentration in reclaimed wastewater suggest that it is more
      likely to form biofilms. Nevertheless, little is known regarding many important
      aspects of the biofilm ecology in reclaimed wastewater distribution systems
      (RWDS), such as the long-term microbial community succession and the underlying
      driving factors. In the present study, by sampling and analysing microbial
      compositions of pipe wall biofilms from six frequently used pipe materials under 
      NaClOdisinfection (sodium hypochlorite-treated), NONdisinfection (without
      disinfection), and UVdisinfection (UV-treated) treatments over one year, it was
      found that the succession of microbial community structure followed a primary
      succession pattern. This primary succession pattern was reflected as increases in
      live cell number and alpha-diversity, along with metagenic succession in
      taxonomic composition. Proteobacteria, Nitrospirae, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria,
      Planctomycetes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia comprised the dominant phyla 
      in biofilm samples. Compared to biofilms in the NaClOdisinfection reactor, the
      bacterial communities of biofilms in NONdisinfection and UVdisinfection reactors 
      were distributed more evenly among different bacterial phyla. Principal component
      analysis revealed a clear temporal pattern of microbial community structures in
      six kinds of pipe wall biofilms albeit a difference in microbial community
      structures among the three reactors. Adonis testing indicated that the microbial 
      community composition variation caused by disinfection methods (R(2)=0.283,
      P<0.01) was more pronounced than that from the time variable (R(2)=0.070, P<0.01)
      and pipe material (R(2)=0.057, P<0.01). Significantly positive correlation
      between average local abundance and occupancy was observed in biofilm communities
      of the three reactors, suggesting that the 'core-satellite' model could be
      applied to identify biofilm-preferential species under specific disinfection
      conditions in RWDS. The prevalence of family Sphingomonadaceae, known to show
      chlorine tolerance and powerful biofilm-forming ability in NaClOdisinfection
      reactors, evidenced the habitat filtering consequent to environment pressure.
      Correlation-based network analysis revealed that taxonomic relatedness such as
      similar niches, cooperation, taxa overdispersion, and competition all functioned 
      toward driving the bacterial assembly succession in RWDS.

AB  - Currently, the effects of high antibiotic concentrations on the performance of
      microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in activated sludge (AS)
      process are not well characterized. Lab-scale batch reactors were performed to
      evaluate the dynamics of microbial community and ARGs in response to six
      antibiotics at different concentrations using high-throughput sequencing-based
      16S rRNA gene and metagenomic analyses. The presence of antibiotics remarkably
      decreased the microbial diversity, caused a great change of the microbiota
      structure, and exerted a selective pressure on the enrichment of potential
      antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB), such as Arthrobacter, Thauera, Geothrix,
      Rudaea, Aridibacter, Conexibacter, Terrimonas, etc. High antibiotic selective
      pressures increased ARG abundance but simultaneously reduced ARG number. In
      total, 491 ARG subtypes belonging to 20 ARG types were detected and kanamycin
      treatment showed the highest ARG abundances. A core set of 54 ARG subtypes that
      accounted for 66.7%-99.6% of the total ARG abundances were shared by all samples.
      The increase of the abundances of both corresponding and non-corresponding ARGs
      under a specific antibiotic treatment revealed the collateral effects of
      antibiotic selective pressure. Microbial community may play an important role in 
      the composition of ARGs. Network analysis indicated that both internal-type and
      external-type of ARGs exhibited higher non-random co-occurrence incidences and 18
      genera were speculated as the possible hosts for multiple ARGs. This study
      deciphered the profiles and relationships between microbial community and ARGs in
      AS process treating wastewater with high antibiotic concentrations and could
      provide helpful guidance for controlling the development and dissemination of ARB
      and ARGs.

AB  - Gut microbial structure in animals depends on the host, dietary habits and local

      of three other Reticulitermes species. Each Reticulitermes species had a
      significantly different bacterial gut microbiota (pairwise significance tests
      using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), but a similar pattern of distribution (P-test
      in weighted Unifrac). The core gut microbiota from the analyzed Reticulitermes
      species contained 16 bacterial operational taxonomic units. Enzymes (KO) were
      detected from 14 pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. R. grassei and R.
      hesperus, based on relative abundance of KO, had the most similar carbohydrate
      pathway patterns. In addition, we described the gut microbiota and functionality 
      pathways in R. grassei after a 7-day dietary shift and antibiotic (ciprofloxacin)
      treatment. Both factors, but above all the antibiotic, altered the relative
      abundance of certain microbial groups, although the changes were not
      statistically significant (P-test in weighted Unifrac). The cellulose diet
      enhanced the carbohydrate pathways related to propanoate, butanoate, ascorbate,
      and glyoxylate metabolism. The antibiotic treatment affected galactose
      metabolism, the citrate cycle and inositol phosphate metabolism. Those functional
      changes may be related to changes in the abundance of several bacterial groups.
      Our findings provide insights into the stability of the gut microbiota in R.
      grassei and a resilience response to dietary shift or antibiotic treatment
      disturbance after 7 days.

TI  - Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome is associated with thyroid cancer and thyroid
      nodules and correlated with clinical index of thyroid function.
PG  - 564-574

AB  - PURPOSE: Thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules are the most prevalent form of
      thyroid endocrine disorder. The balance of gut microbiome is highly crucial for a
      healthy human body, especially for the immune and endocrine system. However, the 
      relationship between gut microbiome and the thyroid endocrine disorders such as
      thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules has not been reported yet. METHODS: A cohort
      of 74 patients was recruited for this study. Among them, 20 patients had thyroid 
      cancer, 18 patients had thyroid nodules, and 36 were matched healthy controls.
      Gut microbiome composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA (16S ribosomal RNA)
      gene-based sequencing protocol. RESULTS: We compared the gut microbiome results
      of 74 subjects and established the correlation between gut microbiome and thyroid
      endocrine function for both thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules. The results
      inferred that alpha and beta diversity were different for patients with thyroid
      tumor than the healthy controls (p < 0.01). In comparison to healthy controls,
      the relative abundance of Neisseria (p < 0.001) and Streptococcus (p < 0.001) was
      significantly higher for thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules. Butyricimonas (p <
      0.001) and Lactobacillus (p < 0.001) displayed notably lower relative abundance
      for thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules, respectively. It was also found that the 
      clinical indexes were correlated with gut microbiome. CONCLUSION: Our results
      indicate that both thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules are associated with the
      composition of gut microbiome. These results may support further clinical
      diagnosis to a great extent and help in developing potential probiotics to
      facilitate the treatment of thyroid cancer and thyroid nodules.

TI  - Finer-Scale Phylosymbiosis: Insights from Insect Viromes.
LID - e00131-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mSystems.00131-18 [doi]
AB  - Phylosymbiosis was recently proposed to describe the eco-evolutionary pattern
      whereby the ecological relatedness (e.g., beta diversity relationships) of
      host-associated microbial communities parallels the phylogeny of the host
      species. Representing the most abundant biological entities on the planet and
      common members of the animal-associated microbiome, viruses can be influential
      members of host-associated microbial communities that may recapitulate,
      reinforce, or ablate phylosymbiosis. Here we sequence the metagenomes of purified
      viral communities from three different parasitic wasp Nasonia species, one
      cytonuclear introgression line of Nasonia, and the flour moth outgroup Ephestia
      kuehniella. Results demonstrate complete phylosymbiosis between the viral
      metagenome and insect phylogeny. Across all Nasonia contigs, 69% of the genes in 
      the viral metagenomes are either new to the databases or uncharacterized, yet
      over 99% of the contigs have at least one gene with similarity to a known
      sequence. The core Nasonia virome spans 21% of the total contigs, and the
      majority of that core is likely derived from induced prophages residing in the
      genomes of common Nasonia-associated bacterial genera: Proteus, Providencia, and 
      Morganella. We also assemble the first complete viral particle genomes from
      Nasonia-associated gut bacteria. Taken together, results reveal the first
      complete evidence for phylosymbiosis in viral metagenomes, new genome sequences
      of viral particles from Nasonia-associated gut bacteria, and a large set of novel
      or uncharacterized genes in the Nasonia virome. This work suggests that
      phylosymbiosis at the host-microbiome level will likely extend to the host-virome
      level in other systems as well. IMPORTANCE Viruses are the most abundant
      biological entity on the planet and interact with microbial communities with
      which they associate. The virome of animals is often dominated by bacterial
      viruses, known as bacteriophages or phages, which can (re)structure bacterial
      communities potentially vital to the animal host. Beta diversity relationships of
      animal-associated bacterial communities in laboratory and wild populations
      frequently parallel animal phylogenetic relationships, a pattern termed
      phylosymbiosis. However, little is known about whether viral communities also
      exhibit this eco-evolutionary pattern. Metagenomics of purified viruses from
      recently diverged species of Nasonia parasitoid wasps reared in the lab indicates
      for the first time that the community relationships of the virome can also
      exhibit complete phylosymbiosis. Therefore, viruses, particularly bacteriophages 
      here, may also be influenced by animal evolutionary changes either directly or
      indirectly through the tripartite interactions among hosts, bacteria, and phage
      communities. Moreover, we report several new bacteriophage genomes from the
      common gut bacteria in Nasonia.

      microbiota in Slovenian healthy cohort.
PG  - e0209209
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0209209 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbiota in a healthy population is shaped by various geographic,
      demographic and lifestyle factors. Although the majority of research remains
      focused on the bacterial community, recent efforts to include the remaining
      microbial members like viruses, archaea and especially fungi revealed various
      functions they perform in the gut. Using the amplicon sequencing approach we
      analysed bacterial and fungal gut communities in a Slovenian cohort of 186
      healthy volunteers. In the bacterial microbiome we detected 253 different genera.
      A core microbiome analysis revealed high consistency with previous studies, most 
      prominently showing that genera Faecalibacterium, Bacteroides and Roseburia
      regularly comprise the core community. We detected a total of 195 fungal genera, 
      but the majority of these showed low prevalence and are likely transient
      foodborne contaminations. The fungal community showed a low diversity per sample 
      and a large interindividual variability. The most abundant fungi were
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. These, along with representatives 
      from genera Penicillium and Debaryomyces, cover 82% of obtained reads. We report 
      three significant questionnaire-based host covariates associated with microbiota 
      composition. Bacterial community was associated with age and gender. More
      specifically, bacterial diversity was increased with age and was higher in the
      female population compared to male. The analysis of fungal community showed that 
      more time dedicated to physical activity resulted in a higher fungal diversity
      and lower abundance of S. cerevisiae. This is likely dependent on different
      diets, which were reported by participants according to the respective rates of
      physical activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand the current research focus and trends in the field of
      snail intestinal flora. METHODS: The literature focusing on snail intestinal
      flora and published from 1998 to 2017 were retrieved from the core database of
      Web of Science. The quantitative analysis of literature was then conducted by
      using CiteSpace software based on the bibliometricsmethod.The research trends
      were then summarized systematically, and the potential research fronts and
      focuses were explored. RESULTS: Totally 139 articles were identified in the field
      of snail intestinal flora. The top three countries with highest publications
      included the United States of American, Brazil, and South Korea; while the top
      three institutions were Kyung Hee University, Osvaldo Cruz Foundation, and Oxford
      University. Five terms were identified as the key words in this field, including 
      diversity, cellulose, Achatina fulica, lignocelluloses, and species nova.
      Meanwhile, 5 critical papers with the citation frequency over 15 were recognized,
      and 5 study clusters were formed including the application, diversity, and
      function of intestinal flora, difference of snail source and flora, and newly
      discovered bacteria in the snail intestine. CONCLUSIONS: The current research
      focuses on intestinal flora of snails include the diversity, function and
      application of intestinal flora.

AB  - Rhizobacteria play an important role in bridging the soil and plant microbiomes
      and improving the health and growth of plants. In this study, the bacterial
      community structures and compositions of rhizosphere microbiomes associated with 
      six plant species, representing two orders and three families of wild plants
      grown in the same field, were evaluated. The six plant species examined harbored 
      a core and similar bacterial communities of the rhizosphere microbiome, which was
      dominated by members of Rhizobiales, Sphingomonadales, Burkholderiales, and
      Xanthomonadales of Proteobacteria, Subgroup 4 of Acidobacteria, and
      Sphingobacteriales of Bacteroidetes. Plant species had a significant effect on
      the microbial composition and Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) abundance of the
      rhizosphere microbiome. Statistical analysis indicated a significant differential
      OTU richness (Chao1, p < 0.05) and bacterial diversity (Shannon index, p <
      0.0001) of the rhizosphere microbiome at the plant species, genus, or families
      levels. The paralleled samples from the same plant species in the PCoA and
      hierarchical cluster analysis demonstrated a clear tendency to group together,
      although the samples were not strictly separated according to their taxonomic
      divergence at the family or order level. The CAP analysis revealed a great
      proportion (44.85%) of the variations on bacterial communities could be
      attributed to the plant species. The results demonstrated that largely conserved 
      and taxonomically narrow bacterial communities of the rhizosphere microbiome
      existed around the plant root. The bacterial communities and diversity of the
      rhizosphere microbiome were significantly related to the plant taxa, at least at 
      the species levels.

AB  - Studies about the composition and diversity of microbial community in the Rare
      Earth Elements-rich muds are limited. In this research, we conducted a
      characterization for the composition and diversity of bacterial and archaeal
      communities from rare earth elements-rich gravity core sediment at approximately 
      4800 meters deep in the Indian Ocean by Illumina high-throughput sequencing
      targeting 16S rRNA genes. The results showed that the most abundant bacteria were
      Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. Amongst
      Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria are present in all sections of this sediment 
      core accounted for a particularly large proportion of bacterial sequences.
      Candidatus Nitrosopumilus, with a higher relative abundance in our samples,
      belongs to Thaumarchaeota. This is the first report on the composition and
      diversity of rare earth elements-rich muds microbial communities in the Indian
      Ocean deep sea.

TI  - Galactose Impacts the Size and Intracellular Composition of the Asaccharolytic
      Oral Pathobiont Porphyromonas gingivalis.
LID - e02268-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02268-18 [doi]
AB  - The asaccharolytic anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis metabolizes proteins it
      encounters in the periodontal pocket, including host-derived glycoproteins such
      as mucins and immunoglobulins. Often, these proteins are protected by a diverse
      array of carbohydrates tethered to the polypeptide chain via glycolytic bonds,
      and P. gingivalis produces enzymes capable of liberating these carbohydrates,
      exposing the proteinaceous core. In this study, we investigated the effect of
      individual monosaccharides, including galactose, l-fucose, mannose, and glucose, 
      on the growth and physiology of P. gingivalis Of the carbohydrates tested, only
      galactose noticeably altered the density of the bacterial culture, and we
      observed that cultures grown with galactose reached significantly higher
      densities during stationary phase. Importantly, electron micrographs and plating 
      of P. gingivalis in stationary phase demonstrated that the presence of galactose 
      did not increase cell numbers; instead, the higher densities resulted from the
      expansion of individual cells which contained large intracellular granules.
      Initial attempts to characterize these granules revealed only a subtle increase
      in soluble carbohydrates, suggesting they are likely not composed of stored
      carbohydrate. Also, an analysis of major surface polysaccharides via an
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) did not reveal significant differences 
      between cells grown with or without galactose. Finally, an initial investigation 
      of the transcriptional changes elicited by galactose in late exponential phase
      suggested that genes important for cell shape and for the general stress response
      may play roles in this phenomenon. Overall, galactose, a monosaccharide commonly 
      present on the surfaces of host proteins, substantially alters the physiology of 
      P. gingivalis via the production of large, currently undefined, intracellular
      granules.IMPORTANCE Environmental perturbations are central to the ability of
      pathobionts, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, to promote the development of
      diseased sites. In the case of periodontal disease, increased local pH, a shift
      to anaerobic surroundings, and the accumulation of Gram-negative anaerobes at the
      expense of Gram-positive cocci are known ecological fluctuations prominently
      associated with progression toward disease. Importantly, in contrast, the
      alterations to subgingival food webs in disease sites remain poorly
      characterized. We hypothesized that given the dramatic shift in community
      structure during disease, it is possible that free carbohydrates, which would
      typically be readily metabolized by Gram-positive cocci after cleavage from
      glycoproteins, may increase in concentration locally and thereby affect the
      physiological state of the subgingival microbiota. In this study, we explored the
      impact of free monosaccharides on P. gingivalis to gain deeper insight into the
      effect of dysbiotic conditions on the growth and physiology of this periodontal
      pathogen.

TI  - Hibernation Leads to Altered Gut Communities in Bumblebee Queens (Bombus
      terrestris).
LID - E188 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/insects9040188 [doi]
AB  - Many reptiles, amphibians, mammals, and insects practice some form of hibernation
      during which their metabolic rate is drastically reduced. This allows them to
      conserve energy and survive the harsh winter conditions with little or no food.
      While it can be expected that a reduction in host metabolism has a substantial
      influence on the gut microbial community, little is known about the effects of
      hibernation on the composition of the microbial gut community, especially for
      insects. In this study, we assessed and compared the bacterial gut community
      composition within the midgut and ileum of indoor-reared queens of Bombus
      terrestris before and after an artificial hibernation period of 16 weeks. Deep
      sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons and clustering of sequence reads
      into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a similarity threshold of 97% revealed
      several bacterial taxa that are known to be strongly associated with corbiculate 
      bees. Bacterial community composition after hibernation compared to before
      hibernation was characterized by higher OTU richness and evenness, with decreased
      levels of the core bacteria Gilliamella (Proteobacteria, Orbaceae) and
      Snodgrassella (Proteobacteria, Neisseriaceae), and increased relative abundance
      of non-core bacteria, including several psychrophilic and psychrotrophic taxa.

TI  - Diet, physical activity and screen time but not body mass index are associated
      with the gut microbiome of a diverse cohort of college students living in
      university housing: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 210

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modifiable lifestyle factors (e.g. dietary intake and physical
      activity) are important contributors to weight gain during college. The purpose
      of this study was to evaluate whether associations exist between body mass index,
      physical activity, screen time, dietary consumption (fat, protein, carbohydrates,
      and fiber), and gut microbial diversity during the first year of college.
      Racially/ethnically diverse college students (n = 82; 61.0% non-white) at a large
      Southwestern university completed self-reported physical activity and 24-h recall
      dietary assessments, height and weight measurements, and provided one fecal
      sample for gut microbiome analysis. Fecal microbial community composition was
      assessed with Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencing of PCR amplified 16S rRNA
      genes. Post-hoc analyses compared microbial diversity by groups of high and low
      physical activity and fiber intake using QIIME and LEfSe bioinformatics software.
      RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were observed between body mass
      index and gut microbiome abundance and diversity. Median daily consumption of
      dietary fiber was 11.2 (7.6, 14.9) g/d, while the median self-reported
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was 55.7 (27.9, 79.3) min/d and
      screen time 195.0 (195.0, 315.0) min/d. Microbial analysis by LEfSe identified
      Paraprevotellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Lachnospira as important phylotypes in
      college students reporting greater MVPA, while Enterobacteriaceae and
      Enterobacteriales were more enriched among students reporting less MVPA (p <
      0.05). Barnesiellaceae, Alphaproteobacteria, and Ruminococcus were more abundant 
      taxa among those consuming less than the median fiber intake (p < 0.05). Post-hoc
      analyses comparing weighted UniFrac distance metrics based on combined categories
      of high and low MVPA and fiber revealed that clustering distances between members
      of the high MVPA-low fiber group were significantly smaller when compared to
      distances between members of all other MVPA-fiber groups (p < 0.0001).
      CONCLUSIONS: Habitual fiber consumption and MVPA behaviors help explain the
      differential abundance of specific microbial taxa and overall gut microbial
      diversity differences in first-year college students.

AB  - Ingestion of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) is inevitable linked to their
      widespread use in food, medicines and other consumer products. However, their
      effects on human microbiota at non-lethal concentrations remain poorly
      understood. In this study, the interactions among 1mugmL(-1) AgNPs, the
      intestinal microbiota, and the probiotic Bacillus subtilis (BS) were tested using
      in-vitro batch fermentation models inoculated with human fecal matter. Results
      from metagenomic investigations revealed that the core bacterial community was
      not affected by the exposure of AgNPs and BS at the later stage of fermentation, 
      while the proportions of rare species changed drastically with the treatments.
      Furthermore, shifts in the Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes (F/B) ratios were observed
      after 24h with an increase in the relative abundance of Firmicutes species and a 
      decrease in Bacteroidetes in all fermentation cultures. The co-exposure to AgNPs 
      and BS led to the lowest F/B ratio. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization analyses
      indicated that non-lethal concentration of AgNPs negatively affected the relative
      percentage of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium coccoides/Eubacterium 
      rectales taxa in the fermentation cultures after 24h. However, exposure to single
      and combined treatments of AgNPs and BS did not change the overall diversity of
      the fecal microflora. Functional differences in cell motility, translation,
      transport, and xenobiotics degradation occurred in AgNPs-treated fermentation
      cultures but not in AgNPs+BS-treated samples. Compared to the control samples,
      treated fecal cultures showed no significant statistical differences in terms of 
      short-chain fatty acids profiles, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on Caco-2cell
      monolayers. Overall, AgNPs did not affect the composition and diversity of the
      core fecal microflora and its metabolic and toxic profiles. This work indicated a
      chemopreventive role of probiotic on fecal microflora against AgNPs, which were
      shown by the decrease of F/B ratio and the unaltered state of some key metabolic 
      pathways.

AB  - The ecological interactions between phytoplankton and marine bacteria have
      important implications for the productivity and biogeochemistry of ocean
      ecosystems. In this study we characterized the microbial assemblages associated
      with multiple isolates of the ecologically important diatom Leptocylindrus using 
      amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, to examine levels of conservation of
      the microbiome across closely related species or strains. We also assessed if the
      microbiome structure of a given diatom strain was dependent on the location from 
      which it was isolated and if the microbiome of cultured isolates significantly
      changed overtime from the seawater in which they were isolated. The bacterial
      assemblages from 36 strains belonging to three species (Leptocylindrus danicus,
      Leptocylindrus convexus, and Leptocylindrus aporus) isolated from six locations
      spanning > 1000 km of south east Australian coastline over 1 year, were dominated
      by the Rhodobacteraceae ( approximately 60%) and the Flavobacteriaceae (
      approximately 10%). Across all strains, only one 'core OTU' (Roseovarius sp.) was
      identified across all samples. We observed no significant differences in
      bacterial community composition between diatom species. Significant differences
      in microbiome structure were, however, observed between diatom strains collected 
      at different sampling times and from differing locations, albeit these two
      factors were coupled. Moreover, while bacterial communities under domestication
      varied from the seawater in which they were isolated, they remained specific to
      the location/month of origin, i.e., different regions and time points harbored
      distinct bacterial communities. Our study delivers new knowledge in relation to
      diatom-bacterial associations, revealing that the location/time from which a
      diatom is isolated plays an important role in shaping its microbiome.

      Host Distinct Bacterial Assemblages With Core Taxa Conserved Across Host
      Genotypes and Sampling Sites.
PG  - 2708
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02708 [doi]
AB  - Virtually all studied plant tissues are internally inhabited by endophytes. Due
      to their relevance for plant growth and health, bacterial microbiota of crop
      plants have been broadly studied. In plant microbiome research the root is the
      most frequently addressed environment, whereas the ecology of microbiota
      associated with reproductive organs still demands investigation. In this work, we
      chose the model grasses Setaria viridis and Setaria pumila to better understand
      the drivers shaping bacterial communities associated with panicles (representing 
      a reproductive organ) as compared to those associated with roots. We collected
      wild individuals of both grass species from 20 different locations across Austria
      and investigated the bacterial assemblages within roots and ripe grain-harboring 
      panicles by 16S rRNA gene-based Illumina sequencing. Furthermore, plant samples
      were subjected to genotyping by genetic diversity-focused Genotyping by
      Sequencing. Overall, roots hosted more diverse microbiota than panicles. Both the
      plant organ and sampling site significantly shaped the root and
      panicle-associated microbiota, whereas the host genotype only affected root
      communities. In terms of community structure, root-specific assemblages were
      highly diverse and consisted of conserved bacterial taxa. In contrast,
      panicle-specific communities were governed by Gammaproteobacteria, were less
      diverse and highly origin-dependent. Among OTUs found in both plant tissues,
      relative abundances of Gammaproteobacteria were higher in panicles, whereas
      Rhizobiales dominated root communities. We further identified core and non-core
      taxa within samples of both Setaria species. Non-core taxa included members of
      the Saccharibacteria and Legionelalles, while core communities encompassed eleven
      OTUs of seven bacterial orders, together with a set of ten panicle-enriched OTUs.
      These communities were widespread across root and panicle samples from all
      locations, hinting toward an evolved form of mutualism through potential vertical
      transmission of these taxa within Setaria species.

      Hepatic Function.
PG  - 2682
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.02682 [doi]
AB  - Cholestasis is a major hepatic disease in infants, with increasing morbidity in
      recent years. Accumulating evidence has revealed that the gut microbiota (GM) is 
      associated with liver diseases, such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis,
      and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, GM alterations in cholestatic infants and 
      the correlation between the GM and hepatic functions remain uninvestigated. In
      this study, 43 cholestatic infants (IC group) and 37 healthy infants (H group)
      were enrolled to detect GM discrepancies using 16S rDNA analysis. The diversity
      in the bacterial community was significantly lower in the IC group than that in
      the H group (P = 0.013). After determining the top 10 abundant genera of microbes
      in the IC and H groups, we found that 13 of them were differentially enriched,
      including Bifidobacterium, Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and
      Staphylococcus. As compared with the H group, the IC group had a more complex GM 
      co-occurrence network featured by three core nodes: Phyllobacterium,
      Ruminococcus, and Anaerostipes. In addition, the positive correlation between
      Faecalibacterium and Erysipelatoclostridium (r = 0.689, P = 0.000, FDR = 0.009)
      was not observed in the IC patients. Using the GM composition, the cholestatic
      patients can be distinguished from healthy infants with high accuracy [areas
      under receiver operating curve (AUC) > 0.97], wherein Rothia, Eggerthella,
      Phyllobacterium, and Blautia are identified as valuable biomarkers. Using KEGG
      annotation, we identified 32 functional categories with significant difference in
      enrichment of the GM of IC patients, including IC-enriched functional categories 
      that were related to lipid metabolism, biodegradation and metabolism of
      xenobiotics, and various diseases. In contrast, the number of functions
      associated with amino acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and vitamins
      metabolism was reduced in the IC patients. We also identified significant
      correlation between GM composition and indicators of hepatic function.
      Megasphaera positively correlated with total bilirubin (r = 0.455, P = 0.002) and
      direct bilirubin (r = 0.441, P = 0.003), whereas gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase
      was positively associated with Parasutterella (r = 0.466, P = 0.002) and
      negatively related to Streptococcus (r = -0.450, P = 0.003). This study describes
      the GM characteristics in the cholestatic infants, illustrates the association
      between the GM components and the hepatic function, and provides a solid
      theoretical basis for GM intervention for the treatment of infantile cholestasis.

AB  - To address the question of how microbial diversity and function in the oral
      cavities of children relates to caries diagnosis, we surveyed the supragingival
      plaque biofilm microbiome in 44 juvenile twin pairs. Using shotgun sequencing, we
      constructed a genome encyclopedia describing the core supragingival plaque
      microbiome. Caries phenotypes contained statistically significant enrichments in 
      specific genome abundances and distinct community composition profiles, including
      strain-level changes. Metabolic pathways that are statistically associated with
      caries include several sugar-associated phosphotransferase systems, antimicrobial
      resistance, and metal transport. Numerous closely related previously
      uncharacterized microbes had substantial variation in central metabolism,
      including the loss of biosynthetic pathways resulting in auxotrophy, changing the
      ecological role. We also describe the first complete Gracilibacteria genomes from
      the human microbiome. Caries is a microbial community metabolic disorder that
      cannot be described by a single etiology, and our results provide the information
      needed for next-generation diagnostic tools and therapeutics for
      caries.IMPORTANCE Oral health has substantial economic importance, with over $100
      billion spent on dental care in the United States annually. The microbiome plays 
      a critical role in oral health, yet remains poorly classified. To address the
      question of how microbial diversity and function in the oral cavities of children
      relate to caries diagnosis, we surveyed the supragingival plaque biofilm
      microbiome in 44 juvenile twin pairs. Using shotgun sequencing, we constructed a 
      genome encyclopedia describing the core supragingival plaque microbiome. This
      unveiled several new previously uncharacterized but ubiquitous microbial lineages
      in the oral microbiome. Caries is a microbial community metabolic disorder that
      cannot be described by a single etiology, and our results provide the information
      needed for next-generation diagnostic tools and therapeutics for caries.

AB  - With increasing fresh water (FW) scarcity, the use of treated wastewater (TWW)
      for crop irrigation is expanding globally. Besides clear benefits, some undesired
      long-term effects of irrigation with this low quality water on plant performance 
      have been reported. As the rhizosphere microbiome can mediate plant-soil
      interactions, an examination of the response of these organisms to TWW is
      necessary to understand the full effects of water quality. In the current study, 
      the effects of irrigation water quality on the microbial community structure of
      soil and roots as well as edaphic properties and plant performance were
      evaluated. We compared soil and roots microbiomes of two different plant species 
      (tomato and lettuce), each grown in two distinct soils, and irrigated with either
      FW or TWW. Irrigation with TWW significantly increase soil pH, EC, K, Na and DOC,
      and decrease plant fruit and shoot weight, relatively to samples irrigated with
      FW. We calculated the effect size of plant species, soil type, and irrigation
      water quality on microbial community structure in soil and root. In the roots,
      plant species and irrigation water were the dominant factors in shaping both
      total (DNA based) and active (RNA based) microbial communities, with both factors
      contributing similarly to the observed microbial population. Soil type and
      irrigation water were the dominant factors shaping the total microbial community 
      in the soil and were of similar magnitude. Irrigation water quality is
      demonstrated to be a major force in shaping root-associated microbiome, leading
      to altered microbial community structure in the critical juncture between plant
      and soil.

AB  - This paper presents study on the microbiome of a unique extreme environment -
      saline and alkaline lime, a by-product of soda ash and table salt production in
      Janikowo, central Poland. High-throughput 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was used
      to reveal the structure of bacterial and archaeal communities in the lime
      samples, taken from repository ponds differing in salinity (2.3-25.5% NaCl).
      Surprisingly abundant and diverse bacterial communities were discovered in this
      extreme environment. The most important geochemical drivers of the observed
      microbial diversity were salinity, calcium ions, nutrients, and water content.
      The bacterial and archaeal communities in saline, alkaline lime were similar to
      those found in natural haloalkaline environments. Although the archaeal
      contribution to the whole microbial community was lower than 4%, the four
      archaeal genera Natronomonas, Halorubrum, Halobellus, and Halapricum constituted 
      the core microbiome of saline, alkaline lime - a set of OTUs (> 0.1% of total
      archaeal relative abundance) present in all samples under study. The high
      proportion of novel, unclassified archaeal and bacterial sequences (not
      identified at 97% similarity level) in the 16S rRNA gene libraries indicated that
      potentially new genera, especially within the class of Thermoplasmata inhabit
      this unique environment.

PG  - e5960

AB  - Animal skin acts as a barrier between the organism and its environment and
      provides the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Thus, skin
      surfaces harbor communities of microbes that are interacting with both the host
      and its environment. Amphibian skin bacteria form distinct communities closely
      tied to their host species, but few studies have compared bacterial communities
      between amphibians and other, non-amphibian sympatric animals. Notably, skin
      microbes on reptiles have gained little attention. We used next-generation
      sequencing technology to describe bacterial communities on the skin of three
      lizard species and compared them to bacteria on six cohabiting frog species in
      the Northern Territory of Australia. We found bacterial communities had higher
      richness and diversity on lizards than frogs, with different community
      composition between reptiles and amphibians and among species. Core bacteria on
      the three lizard species overlapped by over 100 operational taxonomic units. The 
      bacterial communities were similar within species of frogs and lizards, but the
      communities tended to be more similar between lizard species than between frog
      species and when comparing lizards with frogs. The diverse bacteria found on
      lizards invites further questions on how and how well reptiles interact with
      microorganisms through their scaly skin.

TI  - Diazotrophic microbial community and abundance in acidic subtropical natural and

PG  - 995-1005
LID - 10.1007/s00253-018-9466-7 [doi]
AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is an important natural biochemical process
      converting the inert dinitrogen gas (N2) in the atmosphere to ammonia (NH3) in
      the N cycle. In this study, the nifH gene was chosen to detect the diazotrophic
      microorganisms with high-throughput sequencing from five acidic forest soils,
      including three natural forests and two re-vegetated forests. Soil samples were
      taken in two seasons (summer and winter) at two depth layers (surface and lower
      depths). A dataset of 179,600 reads obtained from 20 samples were analyzed to
      provide the microbial community structure, diversity, abundance, and relationship
      with physiochemical parameters. Both archaea and bacteria were detected in these 
      samples and diazotrophic bacteria were the dominant members contributing to the
      biological dinitrogen fixation in the acidic forest soils. Cyanobacteria,
      Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Spirocheates, and Verrucomicrobia were observed,
      especially the Proteobacteria as the most abundant phylum. The core genera were
      Bradyrhizobium and Methylobacterium from alpha-Proteobacteia, and Desulfovibrio
      from delta-Proteobacteia in the phylum of Proteobacteia of these samples. The
      diversity indices and the gene abundances of all samples were higher in the
      surface layer than the lower layer. Diversity was apparently higher in
      re-vegetated forests than the natural forests. Significant positive correlation
      to the organic matter and nitrogen-related parameters was observed, but there was
      no significant seasonal variation on the community structure and diversity in
      these samples between the summer and winter. The application of high-throughput
      sequencing method provides a better understanding and more comprehensive
      information of diazotrophs in acidic forest soils than conventional and PCR-based
      ones.

AB  - 'Core bacterial communities', bacterial species that are found consistently
      throughout a river continuum, have previously been identified. However,
      variations in core and non-core bacterial community structure, as well as the
      relationships between these communities and water chemistry or geographic
      distance have not been well studied. Here, we sampled in the entire course of the
      Le'an River, China, and explored the bacterial community composition at each site
      using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The proportion of sequence reads
      assigned to the core community was ~95% in the upper and middle reaches,
      gradually decreasing below 90% in the lower reaches. Both the Chao1 richness
      index and the Shannon diversity index of the bacterial communities were
      significantly higher in the wet season than in the dry season, and both indices
      increased slightly from upstream to downstream. The variation in the non-core
      community was more aggregated from upstream to downstream in the wet season than 
      in the dry season, while the aggregation of the core community was similar
      between the dry season and the wet season. The proportion of typical freshwater
      bacterial was significantly higher in the core community than in the non-core
      community. NO3(-)-N was the subset of water chemistry parameters that best
      explained bacterial community dissimilarities, while 'river length' was the
      subset of geographic distance parameters that best explained bacterial community 
      dissimilarities. Water chemistry parameters explained more of the variations in
      the bacterial communities than did geographic distance, especially in the dry
      season. However, the correlation between water chemistry and bacteria was
      primarily due to collective allochthonous input (mass effects), not because of
      any nutritious or toxic effects on bacterial growth competition (species
      sorting). The greater influence of the mass effects, as compared to species
      sorting, on bacterial community structure was due to the allochthonous input of
      bacteria from anthropogenic sources.

TI  - Ecological patterns in the skin microbiota of frogs from tropical Australia.

AB  - The microbiota of frog skin can play an important role in protecting against
      diseases and parasites. The frog skin microbial community represents a complex
      mix of microbes that are promoted by the chemical environment of the frog skin
      and influenced by the animal's immediate past environment. The microbial
      communities of six species of frogs sampled from the campus of Charles Darwin
      University (CDU) were more similar within species than between species. The
      microbiota of the introduced cane toad (Rhinella marina) was most dissimilar
      among the species. Pairwise comparisons showed that the microbial communities of 
      each species were different, except for the terrestrial Litoria nasuta and the
      arboreal L. rothii. The microbial communities of the six species were not related
      to ecological habit (arboreal or terrestrial), and neither was the alpha
      diversity of the microbes. The core microbes (defined as being on >/=90% of
      individuals of a species or group) were significantly different among all
      species, although 89 microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were core
      microbes for all six species at CDU. Two species, Rhinella marina and Litoria
      rothii, were sampled at additional sites approximately 10 and 30 km from CDU. The
      microbial communities and the core OTU composition were different among the
      sites, but there were nevertheless 194 (R. marina) and 181 (L. rothii) core OTUs 
      present at all three sites. Thus, the core microbiota varied with respect to
      geographic range and sample size.

AB  - Investigations of plant-soil feedbacks (PSF) and plant-microbe interactions often
      rely exclusively on greenhouse experiments, yet we have little understanding of
      how, and when, results can be extrapolated to explain phenomena in nature. A
      systematic comparison of microbial communities using the same host species across
      study environments can inform the generalizability of such experiments. We used
      Illumina MiSeq sequencing to characterize the root-associated fungi of two
      foundation grasses from a greenhouse PSF experiment, a field PSF experiment,
      field monoculture stands, and naturally occurring resident plants in the field. A
      core community consisting < 10% of total fungal OTU richness but > 50% of total
      sequence abundance occurred in plants from all study types, demonstrating the
      ability of field and greenhouse experiments to capture the dominant component of 
      natural communities. Fungal communities were plant species-specific across the
      study types, with the core community showing stronger host specificity than
      peripheral taxa. Roots from the greenhouse and field PSF experiments had lower
      among sample variability in community composition and higher diversity than those
      from naturally occurring, or planted monoculture plants from the field. Core and 
      total fungal composition differed substantially across study types, and
      dissimilarity between fungal communities did not predict plant-soil feedbacks
      measured in experiments. These results suggest that rhizobiome assembly
      mechanisms in nature differ from the dynamics of short-term, inoculation studies.
      Our results validate the efficacy of common PSF experiment designs to test soil
      inoculum effects, and highlight the challenges of scaling the underlying
      microbial mechanisms of plant responses from whole-community inoculation
      experiments to natural ecosystems.

TI  - Variations in Microbial Diversity and Metabolite Profiles of the Tropical Marine 
      Sponge Xestospongia muta with Season and Depth.
PG  - 243-256
LID - 10.1007/s00248-018-1285-y [doi]
AB  - Xestospongia muta is among the most emblematic sponge species inhabiting coral
      reefs of the Caribbean Sea. Besides being the largest sponge species growing in
      the Caribbean, it is also known to produce secondary metabolites. This study
      aimed to assess the effect of depth and season on the symbiotic bacterial
      dynamics and major metabolite profiles of specimens of X. muta thriving in a
      tropical marine biome (Portobelo Bay, Panama), which allow us to determine
      whether variability patterns are similar to those reported for subtropical
      latitudes. The bacterial assemblages were characterized using Illumina
      deep-sequencing and metabolomic profiles using UHPLC-DAD-ELSD from five depths
      (ranging 9-28 m) across two seasons (spring and autumn). Diverse symbiotic
      communities, representing 24 phyla with a predominance of Proteobacteria and
      Chloroflexi, were found. Although several thousands of OTUs were determined, most
      of them belong to the rare biosphere and only 23 to a core community. There was a
      significant difference between the structure of the microbial communities in
      respect to season (autumn to spring), with a further significant difference
      between depths only in autumn. This was partially mirrored in the metabolome
      profile, where the overall metabolite composition did not differ between seasons,
      but a significant depth gradient was observed in autumn. At the phyla level,
      Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Spirochaete showed a mild-moderate
      correlation with the metabolome profile. The metabolomic profiles were mainly
      characterized by known brominated polyunsaturated fatty acids. This work presents
      findings about the composition and dynamics of the microbial assemblages of X.
      muta expanding and confirming current knowledge about its remarkable diversity
      and geographic variability as observed in this tropical marine biome.

TI  - Core and Dynamic Microbial Communities of Two Invasive Ascidians: Can
      Host-Symbiont Dynamics Plasticity Affect Invasion Capacity?
PG  - 170-184
LID - 10.1007/s00248-018-1276-z [doi]
AB  - Ascidians (Chordata, Ascidiacea) are considered to be prominent marine invaders, 
      able to tolerate highly polluted environments and fluctuations in salinity and
      temperature. Here, we examined the seasonal and spatial dynamics of the microbial
      communities in the inner-tunic of two invasive ascidians, Styela plicata (Lesueur
      1823) and Herdmania momus (Savigny 1816), in order to investigate the changes
      that occur in the microbiome of non-indigenous ascidians in different
      environments. Microbial communities were characterized using next-generation
      sequencing of partial (V4) 16S rRNA gene sequences. A clear differentiation
      between the ascidian-associated microbiome and bacterioplankton was observed, and
      two distinct sets of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), one core and the other
      dynamic, were recovered from both species. The relative abundance of the dynamic 
      OTUs in H. momus was higher than in S. plicata, for which core OTU structure was 
      maintained independently of location. Ten and seventeen core OTUs were identified
      in S. plicata and H. momus, respectively, including taxa with reported
      capabilities of carbon fixing, ammonia oxidization, denitrification, and
      heavy-metal processing. The ascidian-sourced dynamic OTUs clustered in response
      to site and season but significantly differed from the bacterioplankton community
      structure. These findings suggest that the associations between invasive
      ascidians and their symbionts may enhance host functionality while maintaining
      host adaptability to changing environmental conditions.

TI  - Temporal Development of the Culturable, Endophytic Fungal Community in Healthy

AB  - Endophytic fungi play an important role in the life of grapevine, either as
      beneficial microorganisms or as pathogens. Many surveys concerning the fungal
      grapevine community have been conducted. Nevertheless, exactly how the fungal
      community arises within the plant and develops from young shoots to mature vines 
      is still unknown. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to investigate the
      early development of endophytic fungal communities in healthy grapevine branches 
      from 2 months to 8 years old. More than 3800 fungi belonging to 86 operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) were isolated from wood samples and assigned to eight age 
      groups. The community composition within the age groups changed and significant
      differences between young (</= 1 year) and old (> 1 year) branches were found.
      The former were primarily dominated by ubiquitous, fast-growing fungi like
      Alternaria spp., Aureobasidium pullulans, Cladosporium spp., or Epicoccum nigrum,
      while communities of perennial branches additionally harbored many grapevine
      trunk disease (GTD)-associated fungi such as Diplodia seriata or Eutypa lata.
      This work gives an insight into the early development of fungal communities in
      grapevine, the nature and composition of primary settlers and core communities,
      as well as the emergence of GTD-associated fungi in perennial wood. This
      information may help grapevine growers to better estimate the risk in relation to
      the applied training system, producing mainly old branches or young shoots.

AB  - The effects of light intensity (0-225micromolm(-2)s(-1)) on oxygen distribution, 
      lipid production and biological community structure of algal-bacterial granules
      were investigated in six identical photo-sequencing batch reactors (with a
      dark/light cycle of 12h/12h). Typically green algal-bacterial granules could be
      developed at a light intensity of >/=135micromolm(-2)s(-1). The lipid content was
      significantly increased under higher light intensity, while the percentage of
      saturated fatty acid methyl esters was remarkably decreased. Results showed that 
      light intensity >/=90micromolm(-2)s(-1) yielded enough O2 production from algae, 
      creating aerobic/anoxic zone (0.3-0.6mg-O2/L) in the core of granules and thus
      efficient algal-bacterial symbiosis system. Enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus
      removals were achieved in the reactors with stronger light illumination, probably
      attributable to the enrichment of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (Comamonadaceae and 
      Nitrosomonadaceae) and algae (Navicula and Stigeoclonium). Illuminance
      >/=180micromolm(-2)s(-1) was found to be unfavorable for Nitrospiraceae.

TI  - Heterogeneity of Microbial Communities on Deep-Sea Ferromanganese Crusts in the
      Takuyo-Daigo Seamount.
PG  - 366-377
LID - 10.1264/jsme2.ME18090 [doi]
AB  - Rock outcrops of aged deep-sea seamounts are generally covered with Fe and Mn
      oxides, known as ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts. Although the presence of
      microorganisms in Fe-Mn crusts has been reported, limited information is
      currently available on intra- and inter-variations in crust microbial
      communities. Therefore, we collected several Fe-Mn crusts in bathyal and abyssal 
      zones (water depths of 1,150-5,520 m) in the Takuyo-Daigo Seamount in the
      northwestern Pacific, and examined microbial communities on the crusts using
      culture-independent molecular and microscopic analyses. Quantitative PCR showed
      that microbial cells were abundant (10(6)-10(8) cells g(-1)) on Fe-Mn crust
      surfaces through the water depths. A comparative 16S rRNA gene analysis revealed 
      community differences among Fe-Mn crusts through the water depths, which may have
      been caused by changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations. Moreover, community
      differences were observed among positions within each Fe-Mn crust, and
      potentially depended on the availability of sinking particulate organic matter.
      Microscopic and elemental analyses of thin Fe-Mn crust sections revealed the
      accumulation of microbial cells accompanied by the depletion of Mn in valleys of 
      bumpy crust surfaces. Our results suggest that heterogeneous and abundant
      microbial communities play a role in the biogeochemical cycling of Mn, in
      addition to C and N, on crusts and contribute to the extremely slow growth of
      Fe-Mn crusts.

AB  - This study describes the dechlorination ability of acclimated biomass, the
      high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene of such
      microorganisms, and the analysis of their community structure in relation to
      special functions. Two types of acclimated biomass (AB-1 and AB-2) were obtained 
      via different acclimated treatment processes and were used to degrade
      2,4,6trichlorophenol. The degradation pathway and characteristics of
      trichlorophenol degradation were different between the two groups. AB-1 degraded 
      trichlorophenol only to 4-chlorophenol. AB-2 completely dechlorinated
      trichlorophenol and opened the benzene ring. The 16S rRNA high-throughput
      sequencing method was employed to examine the microbial diversity. It was found
      that the microbial richness and diversity of AB-1 were higher than those of AB-2.
      Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were 2.7-fold and 4.3-fold more abundant,
      respectively, in AB-1 than in AB-2. Dechlorination bacteria in AB-1 mainly
      included Desulfobulbus, Desulfovibrio, Dechloromonas, and Geobacter. The
      above-mentioned bacteria were less abundant in AB-2, but the abundance of
      Desulfomicrobium was twofold higher in AB-2 than in AB-1. The two types of
      acclimated biomass contained different hydrogen (H2)-producing bacteria. AB-2
      showed higher abundance and diversity of hydrogen-producing bacteria. There was
      no Ignavibacteriae in AB-1, whereas its abundance in AB-2 was 8.4%. In this
      biomass, Ignavibacteriae was responsible for opening of the benzene ring. This
      study indicates that the abundance and diversity of microorganisms are not
      necessarily beneficial to the formation of a functional dechlorinating community.
      The H2-producing bacteria (which showed greater abundance and diversity) and
      Ignavibacterium were assumed to be core functional populations that gave AB-2
      stronger dechlorination and phenol-degradation abilities. Control of lower
      oxidation reduction potential (Eh) and higher temperatures by means of fresh
      aerobic activated sludge as the starting microbial group, caused rapid complete
      dechlorination of 2,4,6trichlorophenol and benzene ring opening.

AB  - Gut microbial communities are critical for the health of many insect species.
      However, little is known about how gut microbial communities respond to
      anthropogenic changes and how such changes affect host-pathogen interactions. In 
      this study, we used deep sequencing to investigate and compare the composition of
      gut microbial communities within the midgut and ileum (both bacteria and fungi)
      in Bombus terrestris queens collected from natural (forest) and urbanized
      habitats. Additionally, we investigated whether the variation in gut microbial
      communities under each habitat affected the prevalence of two important bumblebee
      pathogens that have recently been associated with Bombus declines (Crithidia
      bombi and Nosema bombi). Microbial community composition differed strongly among 
      habitat types, both for fungi and bacteria. Fungi were almost exclusively
      associated with bumblebee queens from the forest habitats, and were not commonly 
      detected in bumblebee queens from the urban sites. Further, gut bacterial
      communities of urban B. terrestris specimens were strongly dominated by
      bee-specific core bacteria like Snodgrassella (Betaproteobacteria) and
      Gilliamella (Gammaproteobacteria), whereas specimens from the forest sites
      contained a huge fraction of environmental bacteria. Pathogen infection was very 
      low in urban populations and infection by Nosema was only observed in specimens
      collected from forest habitats. No significant relationship was found between
      pathogen prevalence and microbial gut diversity. However, there was a significant
      and negative relationship between prevalence of Nosema and relative abundance of 
      the core resident Snodgrassella, supporting its role in pathogen defense.
      Overall, our results indicate that land-use change may lead to different
      microbial gut communities in bumblebees, which may have implications for
      bumblebee health, survival and overall fitness.

AB  - To understand the ecological impacts of the "Plastisphere", those microbes need
      to be identified that preferentially colonize and interact with synthetic polymer
      surfaces, as opposed to general surface colonizers. It was hypothesized that the 
      microbial biofilm composition varies distinctly between different substrates. A
      long-term incubation experiment was conducted (15month) with nine different
      synthetic polymer films as substrate as well as glass using a natural seawater
      flow-through system. To identify colonizing microorganisms, 16S and 18SrRNA gene 
      tag sequencing was performed. The microbial biofilms of these diverse artificial 
      surfaces were visualized via scanning electron microscopy. Biofilm communities
      attached to synthetic polymers are distinct from glass associated biofilms;
      apparently a more general marine biofilm core community serves as shared core
      among all synthetic polymers rather than a specific synthetic polymer community. 
      Nevertheless, characteristic and discriminatory taxa of significantly different
      biofilm communities were identified, indicating their specificity to a given
      substrate.

LID - 10.1002/mbo3.727 [doi]
AB  - As an important organ to maintain the host's homeostasis, intestinal microbes
      play an important role in development of the organism. In contrast to those of
      terrestrial animals, the intestinal microbes of aquatic organisms are affected by
      environmental microorganisms (including water microorganisms and sediment
      microorganisms). In the present study, the compositional differences of
      intestinal microbes in three representative developmental stages of the Chinese
      mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) were studied. Meanwhile, network association
      analysis, and visualization of the water microorganisms of the crabs' habitat,
      the environment microorganisms in the pond, and the intestinal microbes, was
      carried out. The results showed that the gut microbiota diversity index decreased
      continuously with age, and the four bacteria of Aeromonas (Proteobacteria),
      Defluviitaleaceae (Firmicutes), Candidatus Bacilloplasma (Tenericutes), and
      Dysgonomonas (Bacteroidetes) were the "indigenous" flora of the crab. In the
      network-related analysis with the environment, we found that as the culture time 
      increased, the effect of environmental microorganisms on the intestinal microbes 
      of crabs gradually decreased, and the four "indigenous" bacteria were always
      unaffected by the environmental microorganisms. The results of this study
      identified the core bacteria of the crab and, for the first time, studied the
      relationship between intestinal environmental microorganisms, which will aid the 
      practical production of crabs and will promote research into the relationship
      between specific bacteria and the physiological metabolism of crabs.

TI  - The gut bacteria across life stages in the synanthropic fly Chrysomya
      megacephala.
PG  - 131

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut bacteria are closely associated with host. Chrysomya megacephala,
      as a vector and resource insect, can transmit various pathogenic bacteria and
      consume manure to produce biofertilizer and larva biomass. However, the gut
      bacteria composition and abundance of C. megacephala remain unclear. RESULTS:
      Illumina MiSeq platform was used to compare composition of gut bacterial
      community in eggs, 1-day-old larvae, 5-day-old larvae, pupae, adult females and
      males by sequencing with variation in V4 region of 16S ribosomal DNA gene. In
      total, 928 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained. These OTUs were
      annotated into 19 phyla, 42 classes, 77 orders, 153 families and 289 genera. More
      than 0.5% abundance of 32 OTU core genera were found across all life stages. At
      class level, Alphaproteobacteria, Bacilli, Bacteroidia, Betaproteobacteria,
      Flavobacteriia and Gammaproteobacteria were the most abundant in C. megacephala. 
      Eight species were identified to have significantly different abundance between
      1-d-larvae and 5-day-larvae and took 28.95% of shared species between these two
      groups. Sex-specific bacterial species were identified that Faecalibacterium
      prausnitzii was merely present in females, while Rhodococcus fascians was merely 
      present in males. CONCLUSION: Gut bacteria of C. megacephala varied across life
      stages. The composition and community structure of the bacterial community
      differed from young larvae to mature larvae, while that were similar in adult
      females and males. These data will provide an overall view of bacterial community
      across life stages in C. megacephala with attention on manure associated and
      pathogenic bacteria.

TI  - Rethinking the Coral Microbiome: Simplicity Exists within a Diverse Microbial
      Biosphere.
LID - e00812-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/mBio.00812-18 [doi]
AB  - Studies of the coral microbiome predominantly characterize the microbial
      community of the host species as a collective, rather than that of the
      individual. This ecological perspective on the coral microbiome has led to the
      conclusion that the coral holobiont is the most diverse microbial biosphere
      studied thus far. However, investigating the microbiome of the individual, rather
      than that of the species, highlights common and conserved community attributes
      which can provide insights into the significance of microbial associations to the
      host. Here, we show there are consistent characteristics between individuals in
      the proposed three components of the coral microbiome (i.e., "environmentally
      responsive community," "resident or individual microbiome," and "core
      microbiome"). We found that the resident microbiome of a photoendosymbiotic coral
      harbored <3% ( approximately 605 phylotypes) of the 16S rRNA phylotypes
      associated with all investigated individuals of that species ("species-specific
      microbiome") ( approximately 21,654 phylotypes; individuals from Pachyseris
      speciosa [n = 123], Mycedium elephantotus [n = 95], and Acropora aculeus [n = 91]
      from 10 reef locations). The remaining bacterial phylotypes (>96%)
      (environmentally responsive community) of the species-specific microbiome were in
      fact not found in association with the majority of individuals of the species.
      Only 0.1% ( approximately 21 phylotypes) of the species-specific microbiome of
      each species was shared among all individuals of the species (core microbiome),
      equating to approximately 3.4% of the resident microbiome. We found taxonomic
      redundancy and consistent patterns of composition, structure, and taxonomic
      breadth across individual microbiomes from the three coral species. Our results
      demonstrate that the coral microbiome is structured at the individual
      level.IMPORTANCE We propose that the coral holobiont should be conceptualized as 
      a diverse transient microbial community that is responsive to the surrounding
      environment and encompasses a simple, redundant, resident microbiome and a small 
      conserved core microbiome. Most importantly, we show that the coral microbiome is
      comparable to the microbiomes of other organisms studied thus far. Accurately
      characterizing the coral-microbe interactions provides an important baseline from
      which the functional roles and the functional niches within which microbes reside
      can be deciphered.

TI  - Profiling the airway in the macaque model of tuberculosis reveals variable
      microbial dysbiosis and alteration of community structure.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The specific interactions of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the
      causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), and the lung microbiota in infection are
      entirely unexplored. Studies in cancer and other infectious diseases suggest that
      there are important exchanges occurring between host and microbiota that
      influence the immunological landscape. This can result in alterations in immune
      regulation and inflammation both locally and systemically. To assess whether Mtb 
      infection modifies the lung microbiome, and identify changes in microbial
      abundance and diversity as a function of pulmonary inflammation, we compared
      infected and uninfected lung lobe washes collected serially from 26 macaques by
      bronchoalveolar lavage over the course of infection. RESULTS: We found that Mtb
      induced an initial increase in lung microbial diversity at 1 month post infection
      that normalized by 5 months of infection across all macaques. Several core genera
      showed global shifts from baseline and throughout infection. Moreover, we
      identified several specific taxa normally associated with the oral microbiome
      that increased in relative abundance in the lung following Mtb infection,
      including SR1, Aggregatibacter, Leptotrichia, Prevotella, and Campylobacter. On
      an individual macaque level, we found significant heterogeneity in both the
      magnitude and duration of change within the lung microbial community that was
      unrelated to lung inflammation and lobe involvement as seen by positron emission 
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging. By comparing microbial
      interaction networks pre- and post-infection using the predictive algorithm
      SPIEC-EASI, we observe that extra connections are gained by Actinomycetales, the 
      order containing Mtb, in spite of an overall reduction in the number of
      interactions of the whole community post-infection, implicating Mtb-driven
      ecological reorganization within the lung. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first
      to probe the dynamic interplay between Mtb and host microbiota longitudinally and
      in the macaque lung. Our findings suggest that Mtb can alter the microbial
      landscape of infected lung lobes and that these interactions induce dysbiosis
      that can disrupt oral-airway boundaries, shift overall lung diversity, and
      modulate specific microbial relationships. We also provide evidence that this
      effect is heterogeneous across different macaques. Overall, however, the changes 
      to the airway microbiota after Mtb infection were surprisingly modest, despite a 
      range of Mtb-induced pulmonary inflammation in this cohort of macaques.

TI  - Composition of Intestinal Microbiota in Two Lines of Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus 
      Mykiss) Divergently Selected for Muscle Fat Content.
PG  - 308-320
LID - 10.2174/1874285801812010308 [doi]
AB  - Background: Recently, studies suggest that gut microbiota contributes to the
      development of obesity in mammals. In rainbow trout, little is known about the
      role of intestinal microbiota in host physiology. Objective: The aim of this
      study was to investigate the link between intestinal microbiota and adiposity, by
      high-throughput 16S RNA gene based illumina Miseq sequencing in two rainbow trout
      lines divergently selected for muscle lipid content. Fish from these two lines of
      rainbow trout are known to have a differing lipid metabolism. Methods: Samples
      from the two lines (L for lean and F for fat) were collected from Midgut (M) and 
      Hindgut (H) in juvenile fish (18 months) to compare intestinal microbiota
      diversity. Results: Whatever the lines and intestinal localisation,
      Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria are the dominant phyla in the
      bacterial community of rainbow trout (at least 97%). The results indicate that
      richness and diversity indexes as well as bacterial composition are comparable
      between all groups even though 6 specific OTUs were identified in the intestinal 
      microbiota of fish from the fat line and 2 OTUs were specific to the microbiota
      of fish from the lean line. Our work contributes to a better understanding in
      microbial diversity in intestinal microbiota of rainbow trout. Conclusion:
      Altogether, our study indicates that no major modification of the intestinal
      microbiota is induced by selection for muscle lipid content and associated
      metabolic changes. Finally, we identified members of core microbiota in rainbow
      trout.

TI  - Pediatric asthma comprises different phenotypic clusters with unique nasal
      microbiotas.
PG  - 179
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0564-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric asthma is the most common chronic childhood disease in the 
      USA, currently affecting ~ 7 million children. This heterogeneous syndrome is
      thought to encompass various disease phenotypes of clinically observable
      characteristics, which can be statistically identified by applying clustering
      approaches to patient clinical information. Extensive evidence has shown that the
      airway microbiome impacts both clinical heterogeneity and pathogenesis in
      pediatric asthma. Yet, so far, airway microbiotas have been consistently
      neglected in the study of asthma phenotypes. Here, we couple extensive clinical
      information with 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing to characterize the
      microbiota of the nasal cavity in 163 children and adolescents clustered into
      different asthma phenotypes. RESULTS: Our clustering analyses identified three
      statistically distinct phenotypes of pediatric asthma. Four core OTUs of the
      pathogenic genera Moraxella, Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Haemophilus were 
      present in at least 95% of the studied nasal microbiotas. Phyla (Proteobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) and genera (Moraxella, Corynebacterium,
      Dolosigranulum, and Prevotella) abundances, community composition, and structure 
      varied significantly (0.05 < P </= 0.0001) across asthma phenotypes and one of
      the clinical variables (preterm birth). Similarly, microbial networks of
      co-occurrence of bacterial genera revealed different bacterial associations
      across asthma phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that children and
      adolescents with different clinical characteristics of asthma also show different
      nasal bacterial profiles, which is indicative of different phenotypes of the
      disease. Our work also shows how clinical and microbial information could be
      integrated to validate and refine asthma classification systems and develop
      biomarkers of disease.

TI  - Local confinement of disease-related microbiome facilitates recovery of gorgonian
      sea fans from necrotic-patch disease.
PG  - 14636
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-33007-8 [doi]
AB  - Microbiome disruptions triggering disease outbreaks are increasingly threatening 
      corals worldwide. In the Tropical Eastern Pacific, a necrotic-patch disease
      affecting gorgonian corals (sea fans, Pacifigorgia spp.) has been observed in
      recent years. However, the composition of the microbiome and its disease-related 
      disruptions remain unknown in these gorgonian corals. Therefore, we analysed 16S 
      rRNA gene amplicons from tissues of healthy colonies (n = 19) and from
      symptomatic-asymptomatic tissues of diseased colonies (n = 19) of Pacifigorgia
      cairnsi (Gorgoniidae: Octocorallia) in order to test for disease-related changes 
      in the bacterial microbiome. We found that potential endosymbionts (mostly
      Endozoicomonas spp.) dominate the core microbiome in healthy colonies. Moreover, 
      healthy tissues differed in community composition and functional profile from
      those of the symptomatic tissues but did not show differences to asymptomatic
      tissues of the diseased colonies. A more diverse set of bacteria was observed in 
      symptomatic tissues, together with the decline in abundance of the potential
      endosymbionts from the healthy core microbiome. Furthermore, according to a
      comparative taxonomy-based functional profiling, these symptomatic tissues were
      characterized by the increase in heterotrophic, ammonia oxidizer and
      dehalogenating bacteria and by the depletion of nitrite and sulphate reducers.
      Overall, our results suggest that the bacterial microbiome associated with the
      disease behaves opportunistically and is likely in a state of microbial
      dysbiosis. We also conclude that the confinement of the disease-related
      consortium to symptomatic tissues may facilitate colony recovery.

AB  - Introduction: Despite strong evidence that maturation patterns of the gut
      microbiome in early life influence the risk for childhood asthma, very little is 
      known about gut microbiota patterns in adults with established asthma, and of
      greater interest relationships to phenotypic features that characterise asthma
      heterogeneity. Methods: Fifty-eight faecal samples from 32 adults with (n=24) and
      without (n=8) asthma were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing
      methods to characterise intestinal bacterial composition. Compositional stability
      of paired samples was evaluated and features of gut bacterial community structure
      analysed in relation to extensive clinical characterisation data collected from
      subjects, who were enrolled in a prospective observational cohort study at the
      University of Michigan. Results: Differences in gut bacterial community structure
      were associated with aeroallergen sensitisation and lung function as assessed by 
      forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) %predicted. Associations with FEV1 were
      consistently observed across independent analytic approaches. k-means clustering 
      of the gut microbiota data in subjects with asthma revealed three different
      clusters, distinguished most strongly by FEV1 (p<0.05) and trends in differences 
      in other clinical and inflammatory features. Conclusion: In this pilot study of
      asthmatic and non-asthmatic subjects, significant relationships between gut
      microbiota composition, aeroallergen sensitisation and lung function were
      observed. These preliminary findings merit further study in larger cohorts to
      explore possible mechanistic links to asthma phenotype.

AB  - The structure of microbial communities in a typical Italian-style salami,
      including bacterial and fungal diversity, was investigated by high-throughput
      sequencing technology. A total of 6 phyla, 7 classes, 19 orders, 20 families and 
      28 genera were obtained from 16S rDNA sequences, and a total of 2 phyla, 4
      classes, 4 orders, 5 families, 10 genera and 12 Species were obtained from 18S
      rDNA sequences. The core microbiota was composed of Staphylococcaceae,
      representing up to 97.52% of the total 16S rRNA, and Penicillium digitatum,
      accounting for 99.74% of the total classified 18S rRNA. Lactobacillales and
      Saccharomycetales were detected with a quite low proportion of 1.71 and 0.007%,
      respectively. This study contributes to the knowledge of the microbial diversity 
      involved in salami and presents high-throughput sequencing as a useful tool to
      evaluate microbial diversity and monitor the food-borne pathogens in fermented
      sausage.

      on subsurface sediment bacterial communities.
PG  - 32756-32766
LID - 10.1007/s11356-018-3214-5 [doi]
AB  - Ocean acidification may exacerbate the environmental impact of oil hydrocarbon
      pollution by disrupting the core composition of the superficial (0-1 cm) benthic 
      bacterial communities. However, at the subsurface sediments (approximately 5 cm
      below sea floor), the local biochemical characteristics and the superjacent
      sediment barrier may buffer these environmental changes. In this study, we used a
      microcosm experimental approach to access the independent and interactive effects
      of reduced seawater pH and oil contamination on the composition of subsurface
      benthic bacterial communities, at two time points, by 16S rRNA gene-based
      high-throughput sequencing. An in-depth taxa-specific variance analysis revealed 
      that the independent effects of reduced seawater pH and oil contamination were
      significant predictors of changes in the relative abundance of some specific
      bacterial groups (e.g., Firmicutes, Rhizobiales, and Desulfobulbaceae). However, 
      our results indicated that the overall microbial community structure was not
      affected by independent and interactive effects of reduced pH and oil
      contamination. This study provides evidence that bacterial communities inhabiting
      subsurface sediment may be less susceptible to the effects of oil contamination
      in a scenario of reduced seawater pH.

TI  - Expansion of commensal fungus Wallemia mellicola in the gastrointestinal
      mycobiota enhances the severity of allergic airway disease in mice.
PG  - e1007260
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1007260 [doi]
AB  - The gastrointestinal microbiota influences immune function throughout the body.
      The gut-lung axis refers to the concept that alterations of gut commensal
      microorganisms can have a distant effect on immune function in the lung.
      Overgrowth of intestinal Candida albicans has been previously observed to
      exacerbate allergic airways disease in mice, but whether subtler changes in
      intestinal fungal microbiota can affect allergic airways disease is less clear.
      In this study we have investigated the effects of the population expansion of
      commensal fungus Wallemia mellicola without overgrowth of the total fungal
      community. Wallemia spp. are commonly found as a minor component of the commensal
      gastrointestinal mycobiota in both humans and mice. Mice with an unaltered gut
      microbiota community resist population expansion when gavaged with W. mellicola; 
      however, transient antibiotic depletion of gut microbiota creates a window of
      opportunity for expansion of W. mellicola following delivery of live spores to
      the gastrointestinal tract. This phenomenon is not universal as other commensal
      fungi (Aspergillus amstelodami, Epicoccum nigrum) do not expand when delivered to
      mice with antibiotic-depleted microbiota. Mice with Wallemia-expanded gut
      mycobiota experienced altered pulmonary immune responses to inhaled
      aeroallergens. Specifically, after induction of allergic airways disease with
      intratracheal house dust mite (HDM) antigen, mice demonstrated enhanced
      eosinophilic airway infiltration, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to
      methacholine challenge, goblet cell hyperplasia, elevated bronchoalveolar lavage 
      IL-5, and enhanced serum HDM IgG1. This phenomenon occurred with no detectable
      Wallemia in the lung. Targeted amplicon sequencing analysis of the
      gastrointestinal mycobiota revealed that expansion of W. mellicola in the gut was
      associated with additional alterations of bacterial and fungal commensal
      communities. We therefore colonized fungus-free Altered Schaedler Flora (ASF)
      mice with W. mellicola. ASF mice colonized with W. mellicola experienced enhanced
      severity of allergic airways disease compared to fungus-free control ASF mice
      without changes in bacterial community composition.

AB  - The complex community of microbes living in the human gut plays an important role
      in host wellbeing. However, defining a 'healthy' gut microbiome in terms of
      composition has remained an elusive task, despite its anticipated medical and
      scientific importance. In this regard, a central question has been if there is a 
      'core' microbiome consisting of bacterial groups common to all healthy humans.
      Recent studies have been able to define a compositional core in human gut
      microbiome datasets in terms of taxonomic assignments. However, the description
      of the core microbiome in terms of taxonomic assignments may not be adequate when
      considering subsequent analyses and applications. Through the implementation of a
      dynamic clustering approach in the meta-analyisis of comprehensive 16S rRNA
      marker gene datasets, this study found that the human gut pan-microbiome presents
      a preeminent compositional core comprised of discrete units of varying
      phylogenetic depth present in all individuals studied. Since both microbial
      traits and ecological coherence show signs of phylogenetic conservation, this
      outcome provides a new conceptual framework in the study of the ecosystem, as
      well as important practical considerations which should be taken into account in 
      future research.

TI  - The gut of the finch: uniqueness of the gut microbiome of the Galapagos vampire
      finch.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Darwin's finches are a clade of 19 species of passerine birds native 
      to the Galapagos Islands, whose biogeography, specialized beak morphologies, and 
      dietary choices-ranging from seeds to blood-make them a classic example of
      adaptive radiation. While these iconic birds have been intensely studied, the
      composition of their gut microbiome and the factors influencing it, including
      host species, diet, and biogeography, has not yet been explored. RESULTS: We
      characterized the microbial community associated with 12 species of Darwin's
      finches using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples from 114
      individuals across nine islands, including the unusual blood-feeding vampire
      finch (Geospiza septentrionalis) from Darwin and Wolf Islands. The phylum-level
      core gut microbiome for Darwin's finches included the Firmicutes,
      Gammaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, with members of the Bacteroidetes at
      conspicuously low abundance. The gut microbiome was surprisingly well conserved
      across the diversity of finch species, with one exception-the vampire finch-which
      harbored bacteria that were either absent or extremely rare in other finches,
      including Fusobacterium, Cetobacterium, Ureaplasma, Mucispirillum, Campylobacter,
      and various members of the Clostridia-bacteria known from the guts of carnivorous
      birds and reptiles. Complementary stable isotope analysis of feathers revealed
      exceptionally high delta(15)N isotope values in the vampire finch, resembling top
      marine predators. The Galapagos archipelago is also known for extreme wet and dry
      seasons, and we observed a significant seasonal shift in the gut microbial
      community of five additional finch species sampled during both seasons.
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the overall conservatism of the finch gut
      microbiome over short (< 1 Ma) divergence timescales, except in the most extreme 
      case of dietary specialization, and elevates the evolutionary importance of
      seasonal shifts in driving not only species adaptation, but also gut microbiome
      composition.

AB  - Sediment is the one of most important storage of heavy metal. Microbiotas in
      sediment can be used as the effective indicators of heavy metals. The goal of
      this study was to understand the bacterial communities responding to heavy metal 
      enrichment in sediments and prioritize some factors that affected significantly
      to bacterial community. Sediments were sampled from five river-lake systems in
      the Poyang Lake in dry season, and the bacterial community was analyzed using
      Illumina high-throughput sequencing. Relationships between sediment environment
      and the diversity and structure of bacterial communities were determined by
      correlation analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA). The result indicated that Cd 
      and Sb were identified as the heavy metals of the great risk in sediments.
      Sediments from five river-lake systems shared 31.83% core operational taxonomic
      units (OTUs) of bacterial communities. Proteobacteria (33.54% of total sequences)
      and Actinobacteria (15.04%) were the dominant phyla across all sites. High
      enrichment of heavy metals (MRI and mCd) resulted in low diversity of bacterial
      communities (Simpson index). The RDA revealed pH, OC, mCd, and Efs of As, Pb, Cd 
      were major factors related to bacterial community structure changes. The dominant
      phylum Actinobacteria was regarded as tolerant bacteria, while the dominant
      phylum Proteobacteria was named as resistant bacteria in sediment with high
      anthropogenic Cd enrichment.

      Piglets.

AB  - Weaning is one of the most stressful challenges in the pig's life, which
      contributes to dysfunctions of intestinal and immune system, disrupts the gut
      microbial ecosystem, and therefore compromises the growth performance and health 
      of piglets. To mitigate the negative impact of the stress on early-weaned
      piglets, effective measures are needed to promote gut health. Toward this end, we
      tamed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain and developed a probiotic Duan-Nai-An,
      which is a yeast culture of the tamed S. cerevisiae on egg white. In this study, 
      we tested the performance of Duan-Nai-An on growth and health of early-weaned
      piglets and analyzed its impact on fecal microbiota. The results showed that
      Duan-Nai-An significantly improved weight gain and feed intake, and reduced
      diarrhea and death of early-weaned piglets. Analysis of the gut microbiota showed
      that the bacterial community was shaped by Duan-Nai-An and maintained as a
      relatively stable structure, represented by a higher core OTU number and lower
      unweighted UniFrac distances across the early weaned period. However, fungal
      community was not significantly shaped by the yeast probiotics. Notably, 13
      bacterial genera were found to be associated with Duan-Nai-An feeding, including 
      Enterococcus, Succinivibrio, Ruminococcus, Sharpea, Desulfovibrio, RFN20,
      Sphaerochaeta, Peptococcus, Anaeroplasma, and four other undefined genera. These 
      findings suggest that Duan-Nai-An has the potential to be used as a feed
      supplement in swine production.

AB  - Globally, marine species' distributions are being modified due to rising ocean
      temperatures. Increasing evidence suggests a circum-global pattern of poleward
      extensions in the distributions of many tropical herbivorous species, including
      the ecologically important rabbitfish Siganus fuscescens. Adaptability of a
      species to such new environments may be heavily influenced by the composition of 
      their gastrointestinal microbe fauna, which is fundamentally important to animal 
      health. Siganus fuscescens thus provides an opportunity to assess the stability
      of gastrointestinal microbes under varying environmental conditions. The
      gastrointestinal microbial communities of S. fuscescens were characterized over
      2,000 km of Australia's western coast, from tropical to temperate waters,
      including near its current southern distributional limit. Sequencing of the 16S
      rRNA gene demonstrated that each population had a distinct hindgut microbial
      community, and yet, 20 OTUs occurred consistently in all samples. These OTUs were
      considered the 'core microbiome' and were highly abundant, composing between 31
      and 54% of each population. Furthermore, levels of short chain fatty acids, an
      indicator of microbial fermentation activity, were similar among tropical and
      temperate locations. These data suggest that flexibility in the hindgut
      microbiome may play a role in enabling such herbivores to colonize new
      environments beyond their existing range.

AB  - The gut microbime plays an important role in the health of wild animals. This
      microbial community could be altered by habitat pollution and other human
      activities that threaten the host organisms. Here, we satellite-tracked a flock
      of swan geese (Anser cygnoides) migrating from their breeding area (Khukh Lake,
      Mongolia), with low levels of human activity, to their wintering area (Poyang
      Lake, China) which has been heavily impacted by human activities. Twenty fecal
      samples were collected from each site. High-throughput sequencing of 16S and ITS 
      was employed to explore bacterial and fungal composition and diversity of their
      gut microbiome. Although general composition, alpha-diversity, functional
      prediction, and the central taxa in the phylogenetic networks showed some
      similarities between the two habitats, significant divergences were detected in
      terms of beta-diversity, species abundances, and interaction network topologies. 
      In addition, disease-related and xenobiotic biodegradation pathways, and
      pathogenic bacteria were significantly increased in bacterial communities from
      samples at Poyang Lake. Our results reveal that the gut microbiome of swan geese,
      while somewhat altered after long-distance migration, still maintained a core
      group of species. We also show that habitat environmental stress could impact
      these gut microbial communities, suggesting that habitat pollution could
      indirectly threaten wild animals by altering their gut microbiome.

AB  - In lotic ecosystems highly susceptible to anthropogenic activities, the
      influences of environmental variables on microbial communities and their
      functions remain poorly understood, despite our rapidly increasing sequencing
      ability. In this study, we profiled the microbial communities in the hyporheic
      sediments of a watershed undergoing intensive anthropogenic activities via
      next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA V4-V5 hypervariable regions on Illumina
      MiSeq platform. Tidal impacts on microbial communities were investigated via
      co-occurrence networks. In addition, the influences of physicochemical variables 
      including salinity, and the concentrations of nutrients, organic matter and heavy
      metals on the microbial communities were explored via canonical correspondence
      analyses. The sediment samples were collected from 19 sites covering the whole
      main river stem of the target watershed (n=19; Maozhou river watershed, Shenzhen,
      China). The samples were sub-divided in the field for microbiological analyses
      and measurements of physicochemical variables. The results indicated that core
      microbiome was associated with archaea methanogens and bacteria members from
      Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Synergistetes and
      Firmicutes, among which, gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria genera contributing
      to the cycling of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur were predominant. Site-specific
      microbiomes were revealed that may serve as indicators of local environmental
      conditions (e.g., members affiliated to Oceanospirillales were abundant at sites 
      with salt intrusion). Distinct microbial co-occurrence networks were identified
      for non-tidal, inter-tidal and tidal sites. Major environmental factors
      influencing microbial community composition included the concentrations of
      nitrate and bicarbonate in river water, pore water concentrations of sulfate,
      dissolved organic carbon and electrical conductivity, as well as manganese
      concentrations associated with the solid sediment. Collectively, the results of
      this study provide fundamental insights into the influence of environmental
      perturbations on microbial community composition in a lotic system, which may aid
      in the design of effective remediation and/or restoration strategies in the
      target watershed and beyond.

TI  - Fecal microbiota and bile acid interactions with systemic and adipose tissue
      metabolism in diet-induced weight loss of obese postmenopausal women.
PG  - 244
LID - 10.1186/s12967-018-1619-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiota and bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract profoundly
      alter systemic metabolic processes. In obese subjects, gradual weight loss
      ameliorates adipose tissue inflammation and related systemic changes. We assessed
      how rapid weight loss due to a very low calorie diet (VLCD) affects the fecal
      microbiome and fecal bile acid composition, and their interactions with the
      plasma metabolome and subcutaneous adipose tissue inflammation in obesity.
      METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of VLCD-induced weight loss of
      10% in ten grades 2-3 obese postmenopausal women in a metabolic unit. Baseline
      and post weight loss evaluation included fasting plasma analyzed by mass
      spectrometry, adipose tissue transcription by RNA sequencing, stool 16S rRNA
      sequencing for fecal microbiota, fecal bile acids by mass spectrometry, and
      urinary metabolic phenotyping by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. Outcome measures included
      mixed model correlations between changes in fecal microbiota and bile acid
      composition with changes in plasma metabolite and adipose tissue gene expression 
      pathways. RESULTS: Alterations in the urinary metabolic phenotype following
      VLCD-induced weight loss were consistent with starvation ketosis, protein
      sparing, and disruptions to the functional status of the gut microbiota. We show 
      that the core microbiome was preserved during VLCD-induced weight loss, but with 
      changes in several groups of bacterial taxa with functional implications. UniFrac
      analysis showed overall parallel shifts in community structure, corresponding to 
      reduced abundance of the genus Roseburia and increased Christensenellaceae;g__
      (unknown genus). Imputed microbial functions showed changes in fat and
      carbohydrate metabolism. A significant fall in fecal total bile acid
      concentration and reduced deconjugation and 7-alpha-dihydroxylation were
      accompanied by significant changes in several bacterial taxa. Individual bile
      acids in feces correlated with amino acid, purine, and lipid metabolic pathways
      in plasma. Furthermore, several fecal bile acids and bacterial species correlated
      with altered gene expression pathways in adipose tissue. CONCLUSIONS: VLCD
      dietary intervention in obese women changed the composition of several fecal
      microbial populations while preserving the core fecal microbiome. Changes in
      individual microbial taxa and their functions correlated with variations in the
      plasma metabolome, fecal bile acid composition, and adipose tissue transcriptome.

AB  - Multispecies microbial community in natural solid-state fermentation (SSF) is
      crucial for the formation of Chinese Pu-erh tea's unique quality. However, the
      association between microbiota and tea quality are still poorly understood.
      Herein, shotgun metagenomic and metabolomic analysis showed that significant
      variations in composition of microbiota, collective functional genes, and flavour
      compounds occurred during SSF process. Furthermore, the formation pathways of the
      dominant flavours including theabrownin, methoxy-phenolic compound, alcohol and
      carvone were proposed. Moreover, biological interaction networks analysis among
      functional core microbiota, functional genes, and dominant flavours indicated
      Aspergillus was the main flavour-producing microorganism in the early SSF, while 
      many other genera including Bacillus, Rasamsonia, Lichtheimia, Debaryomyces were 
      determined as the functional core microorganism for flavours production in the
      late SSF. This study provides a perspective for bridging the gap between the
      microbiota and quality in Pu-erh tea, and benefited for further optimizing
      production efficiency and product quality.

AB  - The North American prairie covered about 3.6 million-km(2) of the continent prior
      to European contact. Only 1-2% of the original prairie remains, but the soils
      that developed under these prairies are some of the most productive and fertile
      in the world, containing over 35% of the soil carbon in the continental United
      States. Cultivation may alter microbial diversity and composition, influencing
      the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, and other elements. Here, we explored the
      structure and functional potential of the soil microbiome in paired
      cultivated-corn (at the time of sampling) and never-cultivated native prairie
      soils across a three-states transect (Wisconsin, Iowa, and Kansas) using
      metagenomic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing and lipid analysis. At the Wisconsin
      site, we also sampled adjacent restored prairie and switchgrass plots. We found
      that agricultural practices drove differences in community composition and
      diversity across the transect. Microbial biomass in prairie samples was twice
      that of cultivated soils, but alpha diversity was higher with cultivation.
      Metagenome analyses revealed denitrification and starch degradation genes were
      abundant across all soils, as were core genes involved in response to osmotic
      stress, resource transport, and environmental sensing. Together, these data
      indicate that cultivation shifted the microbiome in consistent ways across
      different regions of the prairie, but also suggest that many functions are
      resilient to changes caused by land management practices - perhaps reflecting
      adaptations to conditions common to tallgrass prairie soils in the region (e.g., 
      soil type, parent material, development under grasses, temperature and rainfall
      patterns, and annual freeze-thaw cycles). These findings are important for
      understanding the long-term consequences of land management practices to prairie 
      soil microbial communities and their genetic potential to carry out key
      functions.

AB  - Establishment of the early-life gut microbiota has a large influence on host
      development and succession of microbial composition in later life stages. The
      effect of commensal yeasts - which are known to create a conducive environment
      for beneficial bacteria - on the structure and diversity of fish gut microbiota
      still remains unexplored. The present study examined the intestinal bacterial
      community of zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae exposed to two fish-derived yeasts by
      sequencing the V4 hypervariable region of bacterial 16S rRNA. The first stage of 
      the experiment (until 7 days post-fertilization) was performed in cell culture
      flasks under sterile and conventional conditions for germ-free (GF) and
      conventionally raised (CR) larvae, respectively. The second phase was carried out
      under standard rearing conditions, for both groups. Exposure of GF and CR
      zebrafish larvae to one of the yeast species Debaryomyces or Pseudozyma affected 
      the bacterial composition. Exposure to Debaryomyces resulted in a significantly
      higher abundance of core bacteria. The difference was mainly due to shifts in
      relative abundance of taxa belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria. In
      Debaryomyces-exposed CR larvae, the significantly enriched taxa included
      beneficial bacteria such as Pediococcus and Lactococcus (Firmicutes).
      Furthermore, most diversity indices of bacterial communities in yeast-exposed CR 
      zebrafish were significantly altered compared to the control group. Such
      alterations were not evident in GF zebrafish. The water bacterial community was
      distinct from the intestinal microbiota of zebrafish larvae. Our findings
      indicate that early exposure to commensal yeast could cause differential
      bacterial assemblage, including the establishment of potentially beneficial
      bacteria.

TI  - Bacterial Diversity in Replicated Hydrogen Sulfide-Rich Streams.
PG  - 559-573
LID - 10.1007/s00248-018-1237-6 [doi]
AB  - Extreme environments typically require costly adaptations for survival, an
      attribute that often translates to an elevated influence of habitat conditions on
      biotic communities. Microbes, primarily bacteria, are successful colonizers of
      extreme environments worldwide, yet in many instances, the interplay between
      harsh conditions, dispersal, and microbial biogeography remains unclear. This
      lack of clarity is particularly true for habitats where extreme temperature is
      not the overarching stressor, highlighting a need for studies that focus on the
      role other primary stressors (e.g., toxicants) play in shaping biogeographic
      patterns. In this study, we leveraged a naturally paired stream system in
      southern Mexico to explore how elevated hydrogen sulfide (H2S) influences
      microbial diversity. We sequenced a portion of the 16S rRNA gene using bacterial 
      primers for water sampled from three geographically proximate pairings of streams
      with high (> 20 muM) or low (~ 0 muM) H2S concentrations. After exploring
      bacterial diversity within and among sites, we compared our results to a previous
      study of macroinvertebrates and fish for the same sites. By spanning multiple
      organismal groups, we were able to illuminate how H2S may differentially affect
      biodiversity. The presence of elevated H2S had no effect on overall bacterial
      diversity (p = 0.21), a large effect on community composition (25.8% of variation
      explained, p < 0.0001), and variable influence depending upon the group-whether
      fish, macroinvertebrates, or bacteria-being considered. For bacterial diversity, 
      we recovered nine abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that comprised a
      core H2S-rich stream microbiome in the region. Many H2S-associated OTUs were
      members of the Epsilonproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria, which both have
      been implicated in endosymbiotic relationships between sulfur-oxidizing bacteria 
      and eukaryotes, suggesting the potential for symbioses that remain to be
      discovered in these habitats.

PG  - 2289-2299
LID - 10.2147/COPD.S167618 [doi]
AB  - Background: The role of airway microbiota in COPD is highly debated. Symptomology
      assessment is vital for the management of clinically stable COPD patients;
      however, the link between symp toms and the airway microbiome is currently
      unknown. Purpose: The present study aimed to evaluate the relationship among
      stable COPD patients. Patients and methods: We conducted pyrosequencing of
      bacterial 16S rRNA using induced sputum samples in a Han Chinese cohort that
      included 40 clinically stable COPD patients and 19 healthy controls. Results:
      Alterations in community composition and core bacte rial taxa (Neisseria
      subflava, etc.) were observed in patients with severe symptoms compared with
      controls. The co-occurrence network indicated that the key microbiota enriched in
      COPD patients showed higher expression in patients with severe symptoms. The
      association pattern of symptoms with the sputum microbiome was obviously
      different from that of lung function in COPD patients. Conclusion: These findings
      broaden our insights into the relationship between the sputum microbiota and the 
      symptom severity in COPD patients, emphasizing the role of symptoms in the airway
      microbiome, independent of lung function.

TI  - The gut microbiome is associated with behavioural task in honey bees.
PG  - 419-429
LID - 10.1007/s00040-018-0624-9 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiome is recognised as playing an integral role in the health and
      ecology of a wide variety of animal taxa. However, the relationship between
      social behavioural traits and the microbial community has received little
      attention. Honey bees are highly social and the workers perform different
      behavioural tasks in the colony that cause them to be exposed to different local 
      environments. Here we examined whether the gut microbial community composition of
      worker honey bees is associated with the behavioural tasks they perform, and
      therefore also the local environment they are exposed to. We set up five
      observation hives, in which all workers were matched in age and observed the
      behaviour of marked bees in each colony over 4 days. The gut bacterial
      communities of bees seen performing predominantly foraging or predominantly in
      nest tasks were then characterised and compared based on amplicon sequencing of
      the 16S rRNA gene. Our results show that some core members of the unique honey
      bee gut bacterial community are represented in different relative abundances in
      bees performing different behavioural tasks. The differentially represented
      bacterial taxa include some thought to be important in carbohydrate metabolism
      and transport, and also linked to bee health. The results suggest an influence of
      task-related local environment exposure and diet on the honey bee gut microbial
      community and identify focal core taxa for further functional analyses.

TI  - Initial description of the core ocular surface microbiome in dogs: Bacterial
      community diversity and composition in a defined canine population.
PG  - 337-344
LID - 10.1111/vop.12599 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the bacterial community residing on the conjunctiva of
      clinically healthy dogs. METHODS: Bacterial DNA from conjunctival swabs of 10
      dogs with normal ocular examinations (both OD and OS, n = 20) was extracted, and 
      16S rRNA amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq 600. Resulting data were
      subjected to quality control steps, and analyzed for bacterial community richness
      and diversity, within- and between-group dissimilarity, and relative taxonomic
      composition. RESULTS: High-quality reads (2.22 million bp) resulted in a mean of 
      159 068 sequences per sample. Bacterial community evenness and diversity was high
      when compared to other species, and did not significantly differ when samples
      were grouped by dogs or eyes. As expected, within-dog samples were more similar
      than between-dog samples. Taxonomic classification revealed that >95% of the
      community consisted of Firmicutes (34.9 +/- 8.8%), Actinobacteria (26.3 +/-
      7.1%), Proteobacteria (26.2 +/- 6.6%), and Bacteroidetes (9.4 +/- 2.4%). Key
      members of the dog ocular surface microbiome, found in all dogs and corresponding
      to >25% of all identified OTUs (operational taxonomic units), were part of the
      Bifidobacteriaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Moraxellaceae, Corynebacteriaceae families. 
      Genera previously thought to account for the majority of the core ocular surface 
      microbiome in the dog (Staphylococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., and Bacillus sp.)
      were associated with only 2.63% of overall reads. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows
      the feasibility of conjunctival swabs and high-throughput sequencing to profile
      the bacterial community structure of the canine ocular surface. A core ocular
      surface microbiome was identified for this canine population.

TI  - High-Throughput Analysis Reveals Seasonal Variation of the Gut Microbiota
      Composition Within Forest Musk Deer (Moschus berezovskii).
PG  - 1674
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01674 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota plays a key role in the nutritional ecology of ruminants, and 
      host diet has a significant effect on these microbial communities. Longitudinal
      studies assessing variation of seasonal microbiota in animals can provide a
      comparative context for interpreting the adaptive significance of such changes.
      However, few studies have investigated the effects of seasonally-related dietary 
      shifts on the gut microbial communities of endangered forest musk deer (FMD), and
      the national breeding programs need this information to promote the growth of
      captive populations. The present study applied bacterial 16S rRNA genes based on 
      high-throughput sequencing to profile the fecal microbial communities of FMD
      across four seasons. Microbial diversity was higher in seasons with dry leaf
      diets (winter and spring) compared to seasons with fresh leaf diets (summer and
      autumn). The dominant microbial phyla were Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and the 
      core bacterial taxa also comprised mostly (94.40% of shared OTUs) Firmicutes (37 
      taxa) and Bacteroidetes (6 taxa), which were relatively stable across different
      seasons. The Firmicutes-Bacteroidetes ratio declined in seasons with fresh leaf
      diets relative to seasons with dry leaf diets, and the dominant genera among the 
      four seasons showed no significant variation in abundance. This work explores the
      seasonal variation in the microbial communities of FMD for the first time, and
      reveals how gut microbial community dynamics vary seasonally in accordance with
      differences in dietary plants (fresh and dry leaf). These results indicate that
      the annual cyclic reconfiguration of FMD gut microbiota could be associated with 
      shifts in dietary nutrients, which is important information to inform captive FMD
      management.

TI  - A Single Vibrionales 16S rRNA Oligotype Dominates the Intestinal Microbiome in
      Two Geographically Separated Atlantic cod Populations.
PG  - 1561
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01561 [doi]
AB  - Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) provides an interesting species for the study of
      host-microbe interactions because it lacks the MHC II complex that is involved in
      the presentation of extracellular pathogens. Nonetheless, little is known about
      the diversity of its microbiome in natural populations. Here, we use
      high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA V4 region, amplified with the primer
      design of the Earth Microbiome Project (EMP), to investigate the microbial
      composition in gut content and mucosa of 22 adult individuals from two coastal
      populations in Norway, located 470 km apart. We identify a core microbiome of 23 
      OTUs (97% sequence similarity) in all individuals that comprises 93% of the total
      number of reads. The most abundant orders are classified as Vibrionales,
      Fusobacteriales, Clostridiales, and Bacteroidales. While mucosal samples show
      significantly lower diversity than gut content samples, no differences in OTU
      community composition are observed between the two geographically separated
      populations. All specimens share a limited number of abundant OTUs. Moreover, the
      most abundant OTU consists of a single oligotype (order Vibrionales, genus
      Photobacterium) that represents nearly 50% of the reads in both locations. Our
      results suggest that these microbiomes comprise a limited number of species or
      that the EMP V4 primers do not yield sufficient resolution to confidently
      separate these communities. Our study contributes to a growing body of literature
      that shows limited spatial differentiation of the intestinal microbiomes in
      marine fish based on 16S rRNA sequencing, highlighting the need for multi-gene
      approaches to provide more insight into the diversity of these communities.

AB  - In this study, a novel type of mesophilic anaerobic bioreactor-an expanded
      granular sludge bed (EGSB)-was utilized to explore the effect of suspending
      reactor operation on the treatment performance and the microbial community
      structure. The parameters of performance and bacterial community before and after
      a four-week suspension were compared for the starch processing wastewater
      treatment bioreactor. The results indicate that the removal rate of the organic
      matter remained higher than 90%, although the biomass significantly decreased
      after restarting the reactor. However, the relatively stable microbial community 
      structure before the suspension was altered significantly during the restart and 
      post-running stages. This change was primarily due to variability in satellite
      species and the substitution effect of different dominant bacteria. For example, 
      some non-major carbohydrate-degrading bacteria that were sensitive to nutrition
      deficiency, such as Desulfovibrio and Geobacter, were dramatically reduced after 
      the suspension. In contrast, the stress of starvation stimulated the reproduction
      of hydrolytic bacteria, such as Macellibacteroides. However, the high bacterial
      diversity index (6.12-6.65) and the longstanding core species, including
      Chloroflexi, Cloacimonetes, Ignavibacteriae, Thermotogae and Euryarchaeota,
      maintained the functional stability of the reactor. Consequently, although the
      total bacteria decreased significantly after reactor operation was suspended,
      sufficient functional bacteria supported by the high diversity, as well as the
      longstanding core species, guaranteed the effective degradation after suspension.

TI  - Identifying the core bacterial and fungal communities within four agricultural
      biobeds used for the treatment of pesticide rinsates.
PG  - 1333-1342
LID - 10.1111/jam.14051 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study evaluated the variability of bacterial and fungal communities
      within unique pesticide remediation biobeds. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four biobeds
      receiving different applied pesticide rinsates, were sampled throughout an
      operational season to determine pesticide removal efficacy and microbial
      communities. Biomixture samples collected from different biobed depths, were
      subjected to Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA (bacteria) and ITS2 (fungi)
      genes. Pesticide removal rates for all biobeds averaged 99%, with microbial
      community analysis revealing biobeds shared 60-70% of the most abundant bacterial
      and fungal orders, respectively. Though biobed depth did not greatly impact
      microbial community profile or diversity, bacterial and fungal taxa profiles
      between biobeds notably diverge at levels of genera and OTU. Biobed bacterial
      communities exhibited greater diversity than fungal communities between and
      within all biobeds. CONCLUSIONS: Biobeds receiving variable pesticide rinsates
      share a 'core' microbial community, exhibiting greater bacterial diversity
      relative to fungal diversity. Pesticide exposure increased bacterial diversity
      throughout the biobeds, while fungal diversity was variable, meriting further
      understanding of fungicide application to biobed fungal community stability.
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Biobeds achieve high treatment efficacy of 
      unique pesticide rinsates, regardless of differentiation of specific genera in
      response to specific compounds; supporting biobeds as a robust engineered system 
      for pesticide rinsates bioremediation.

TI  - Comparative metatranscriptomics reveals extracellular electron transfer pathways 
      conferring microbial adaptivity to surface redox potential changes.

AB  - Some microbes can capture energy through redox reactions with electron flow to
      solid-phase electron acceptors, such as metal-oxides or poised electrodes, via
      extracellular electron transfer (EET). While diverse oxide minerals, exhibiting
      different surface redox potentials, are widely distributed on Earth, little is
      known about how microbes sense and use the minerals. Here we show
      electrochemical, metabolic, and transcriptional responses of EET-active microbial
      communities established on poised electrodes to changes in the surface redox
      potentials (as electron acceptors) and surrounding substrates (as electron
      donors). Combination of genome-centric stimulus-induced metatranscriptomics and
      metabolic pathway investigation revealed that nine Geobacter/Pelobacter microbes 
      performed EET activity differently according to their preferable surface
      potentials and substrates. While the Geobacter/Pelobacter microbes coded numerous
      numbers of multi-heme c-type cytochromes and conductive e-pili, wide variations
      in gene expression were seen in response to altering surrounding substrates and
      surface potentials, accelerating EET via poised electrode or limiting EET via an 
      open circuit system. These flexible responses suggest that a wide variety of
      EET-active microbes utilizing diverse EET mechanisms may work together to provide
      such EET-active communities with an impressive ability to handle major changes in
      surface potential and carbon source availability.

PG  - 4444-4460
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14366 [doi]
AB  - Mineral-associated microbes drive many critical soil processes, including mineral
      weathering, soil aggregation and cycling of mineral-sorbed organic matter. To
      investigate the interactions between soil minerals and microbes in the
      rhizosphere, we incubated three types of minerals (ferrihydrite, kaolinite and
      quartz) and a native soil mineral fraction near roots of a common Californian
      annual grass, Avena barbata, growing in its resident soil. We followed microbial 
      colonization of these minerals for up to 2.5 months - the plant's lifespan.
      Bacteria and fungi that colonized mineral surfaces during this experiment
      differed across mineral types and differed from those in the background soil,
      implying that microbial colonization was the result of processes in addition to
      passive movement with water to mineral surfaces. Null model analysis revealed
      that dispersal limitation was a dominant factor structuring mineral-associated
      microbial communities for all mineral types. Once bacteria arrived at a mineral
      surface, capacity for rapid growth appeared important, as ribosomal copy number
      was significantly correlated with relative enrichment on minerals. Glomeromycota 
      (a phylum associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) appeared to
      preferentially associate with ferrihydrite surfaces. The mechanisms enabling the 
      colonization of soil minerals may be foundational in shaping the overall soil
      microbiome composition and development of persistent organic matter in soils.

TI  - Bacterial diversity of bat guano from Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan,
      Philippines: A first report on the metagenome of Philippine bat guano.
PG  - e0200095
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0200095 [doi]
AB  - Bats are highly diverse and ecologically valuable mammals. They serve as host to 
      bacteria, viruses and fungi that are either beneficial or harmful to its colony
      as well as to other groups of cave organisms. The bacterial diversity of two bat 
      guano samples, C1 and C2, from Cabalyorisa Cave, Mabini, Pangasinan, Philippines 
      were investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. V3-V4 hypervariable
      regions were amplified and then sequenced using Illumina MiSeq 250 PE system.
      Reads were processed using Mothur and QIIME pipelines and assigned 12,345 OTUs
      for C1 and 5,408 OTUs for C2. The most dominant OTUs in C1 belong to the
      Proteobacteria (61.7%), Actinobacteria (19.4%), Bacteroidetes (4.2%), Firmicutes 
      (2.7%), Chloroflexi (2.5%), candidate phylum TM7 (2.3%) and Planctomycetes (1.9%)
      while Proteobacteria (61.7%) and Actinobacteria (34.9%) dominated C2. Large
      proportion of sequence reads mainly associated with unclassified bacteria
      indicated possible occurrence of novel bacteria in both samples. XRF
      spectrophotometric analyses of C1 and C2 guano revealed significant differences
      in the composition of both major and trace elements. C1 guano recorded high
      levels of Si, Fe, Mg, Al, Mn, Ti and Cu while C2 samples registered high
      concentrations of Ca, P, S, Zn and Cr. Community structure of the samples were
      compared with other published community profiling studies from Finland
      (SRR868695), Meghalaya, Northeast India (SRR1793374) and Maharashtra State, India
      (CGS). Core microbiome among samples were determined for comparison. Variations
      were observed among previously studied guano samples and the Cabalyorisa Cave
      samples were attributed to either bat sources or age of the guano. This is the
      first study on bacterial diversity of guano in the Philippines through
      high-throughput sequencing.

TI  - Disease outbreak accompanies the dispersive structure of shrimp gut bacterial
      community with a simple core microbiota.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1186/s13568-018-0644-x [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence has emerged supporting a tight link between gut bacterial
      community and shrimp health. However, the knowledge about the variation of gut
      bacterial community, especially with different disease onset time, remains
      elusive. Here, healthy and diseased shrimps were collected at 3 disease-outbreak 
      times (day 70, 80 and 85) to investigate the variation of gut bacterial community
      and its underlying ecological process with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The
      gut bacterial community of diseased shrimp was distinct from the healthy one and 
      temporally less stable, characterized by decreased alpha-diversity and dispersive
      structure. And its dominant ecological process experienced a transition with
      disease onset time, although deterministic process mainly governed the healthy
      gut bacterial assembly. In addition, the core microbiota of healthy shrimp gut
      harbored more diverse bacterial taxa with more cooperative interactions, while
      the diseased core microbiota showed opposite pattern with significantly higher
      abundance of opportunistic pathogens as well. These findings indicate that shrimp
      heath is highly relevant to the homeostasis of its gut bacterial community.
      Preservation and restoration of the bacterial community equilibrium could
      represent an effective strategy for shrimp disease prevention.

TI  - Microbial Community Composition Reveals Spatial Variation and Distinctive Core
      Microbiome of the Weaver Ant Oecophylla smaragdina in Malaysia.
PG  - 10777
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-29159-2 [doi]
AB  - The weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina is an aggressive predator of other
      arthropods and has been employed as a biological control agent against many
      insect pests in plantations. Despite playing important roles in pest management, 
      information about the microbiota of O. smaragdina is limited. In this work, a
      number of O. smaragdina colonies (n = 12) from Malaysia had been studied on their
      microbiome profile using Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We
      characterized the core microbiota associated with these O. smaragdina and
      investigated variation between colonies from different environments. Across all
      12 samples, 97.8% of the sequences were assigned to eight bacterial families and 
      most communities were dominated by families Acetobacteraceae and
      Lactobacillaceae. Comparison among colonies revealed predominance of
      Acetobacteraceae in O. smaragdina from forest areas but reduced abundance was
      observed in colonies from urban areas. In addition, our findings also revealed
      distinctive community composition in O. smaragdina showing little taxonomic
      overlap with previously reported ant microbiota. In summary, our work provides
      information regarding microbiome of O. smaragdina which is essential for
      establishing healthy colonies. This study also forms the basis for further study 
      on microbiome of O. smaragdina from other regions.

AB  - The EU-protected slug Geomalacus maculosus Allman occurs only in the West of
      Ireland and in northern Spain and Portugal. We explored the microbial community
      found within the faeces of Irish specimens with a view to determining whether a
      core microbiome existed among geographically isolated slugs which could give
      insight into the adaptations of G. maculosus to the available food resources
      within its habitat. Faecal samples of 30 wild specimens were collected throughout
      its Irish range and the V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was sequenced
      using Illumina MiSeq. To investigate the influence of diet on the microbial
      composition, faecal samples were taken and sequenced from six laboratory reared
      slugs which were raised on two different foods. We found a widely diverse
      microbiome dominated by Enterobacteriales with three core OTUs shared between all
      specimens. While the reared specimens appeared clearly separated by diet in NMDS 
      plots, no significant difference between the slugs fed on the two different diets
      was found. Our results indicate that while the majority of the faecal microbiome 
      of G. maculosus is probably dependent on the microhabitat of the individual
      slugs, parts of it are likely selected for by the host.

AB  - The biological potential of conventional wastewater treatment plants to remove
      micropollutants mainly depends on process conditions and the predominant
      microbial community. To explore this dependence and to connect the occurrence of 
      genera with operating conditions, five pilot-scale reactors with different
      process conditions were combined into two reactor cascades and fed with the
      effluent of the primary clarifier of a municipal WWTP. All reactors and the WWTP 
      were analyzed for the removal of 33 micropollutants by LC-MS/MS and the presence 
      of the microbial community using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The overall removal of
      the micropollutants was slightly improved (ca. 20%) by the reactor cascades in
      comparison to the WWTP while certain compounds such as diatrizoate, venlafaxine
      or diclofenac showed an enhanced removal (ca. 70% in one or both cascades). To
      explore the diverse bacteria in more detail, the general community was divided
      into a core and a specialized community. Despite their profoundly different
      operating parameters (especially redox conditions), the different treatments
      share a core community consisted of 143 genera (9% of the overall community).
      Furthermore, the alpha- and beta-biodiversity as well as the occurrence of
      several genera belonging to the specialized microbial community could be linked
      to the prevalent process conditions of the individual treatments. Members of the 
      specialized community also correlated with the removal of certain groups of
      micropollutants. Hence, the comparison of the specialized community with
      micropollutant removal and operating conditions via correlation analysis is a
      valuable tool for an extended evaluation of prevalent process conditions. Based
      on an extended data set this approach could also be used to identify organisms as
      indicators for operating conditions which are beneficial for an improved removal 
      of specific micropollutants.

AB  - The diversity and basic functional attributes of the gut microbiome of healthy
      Indians is not well understood. This study investigated the gut microbiome of
      three Indian communities: individuals residing in rural and urban (n = 49) sea
      level Ballabhgarh areas and in rural high altitude areas of Leh, Ladakh in North 
      India (n = 35). Our study revealed that the gut microbiome of Indian communities 
      is dominated by Firmicutes followed by Bacteroidetes, Actinobateria and
      Proteobacteria. Although, 54 core bacterial genera were detected across the three
      distinct communities, the gut bacterial composition displayed specific signatures
      and was observed to be influenced by the topographical location and dietary
      intake of the individuals. The gut microbiome of individuals living in Leh was
      observed to be significantly similar with a high representation of Bacteroidetes 
      and low abundance of Proteobacteria. In contrast, the gut microbiome of
      individuals living in Ballabhgarh areas harbored higher number of Firmicutes and 
      Proteobacteria and is enriched with microbial xenobiotic degradation pathways.
      The rural community residing in sea level Ballabhgarh areas has unique microbiome
      characterized not only by a higher diversity, but also a higher degree of
      interindividual homogeneity.

TI  - Overlapping Community Compositions of Gut and Fecal Microbiomes in Lab-Reared and
      Field-Collected German Cockroaches.
LID - e01037-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01037-18 [doi]
AB  - German cockroaches, Blattella germanica (Blattodea: Ectobiidae), are human
      commensals that move freely between food and waste, disseminating bacteria,
      including potential pathogens, through their feces. However, the relationship
      between the microbial communities of the cockroach gut and feces is poorly
      understood. We analyzed the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the V9 region of
      the 18S rRNA gene by next-generation sequencing (NGS) to compare the bacterial
      and protist diversities in guts versus feces and males versus females, as well as
      assess variation across cockroach populations. Cockroaches harbored a diverse
      array of bacteria, and 80 to 90% of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were
      shared between the feces and gut. Lab-reared and field-collected cockroaches had 
      distinct microbiota, and whereas lab-reared cockroaches had relatively conserved 
      communities, considerable variation was observed in the microbial community
      composition of cockroaches collected in different apartments. Nonetheless,
      cockroaches from all locations shared some core bacterial taxa. The eukaryotic
      community in the feces of field-collected cockroaches was found to be more
      diverse than that in lab-reared cockroaches. These results demonstrate that
      cockroaches disseminate their gut microbiome in their feces, and they underscore 
      the important contribution of the cockroach fecal microbiome to the microbial
      diversity of cockroach-infested homes.IMPORTANCE The German cockroach infests
      diverse human-built structures, including homes and hospitals. It produces potent
      allergens that trigger asthma and disseminates opportunistic pathogens in its
      feces. A comprehensive understanding of gut and fecal microbial communities of
      cockroaches is essential not only to understand their contribution to the biology
      of the cockroach, but also for exploring their clinical relevance. In this study,
      we compare the diversity of bacteria and eukaryotes in the cockroach gut and
      feces and assess the variation in the gut microbiota across cockroach
      populations.

TI  - Guano exposed: Impact of aerobic conditions on bat fecal microbiota.
PG  - 5563-5574
LID - 10.1002/ece3.4084 [doi]
AB  - Bats and their associated guano microbiota provide important terrestrial and
      subterranean ecosystem services and serve as a reservoir for a wide range of
      epizootic and zoonotic diseases. Unfortunately, large-scale studies of bats and
      their guano microbiotas are limited by the time and cost of sample collection,
      which requires specially trained individuals to work at night to capture bats
      when they are most active. Indirectly surveying bat gut microbiota through guano 
      deposits could be a more cost-effective alternative, but it must first be
      established whether the postdefecation exposure to an aerobic environment has a
      large impact on the guano microbial community. A number of recent studies on
      mammalian feces have shown that the impact of aerobic exposure is highly species 
      specific; therefore, it is difficult to predict how exposure will affect the bat 
      guano microbiota without empirical data. In our study, we collected fresh guano
      samples from 24 individuals of 10 bat species that are common throughout the arid
      environments of the American southwest and subjected the samples to 0, 1, and 12 
      hr of exposure. The biodiversity decreased rapidly after the shift from an
      anaerobic to an aerobic environment-much faster than previously reported in
      mammalian species. However, the relative composition of the core guano microbiota
      remained stable and, using highly sensitive targeted PCR methods, we found that
      pathogens present in the original, non-exposed samples could still be recovered
      after 12 hr of exposure. These results suggest that with careful sample analysis 
      protocols, a more efficient passive collection strategy is feasible; for example,
      guano could be collected on tarps placed near the roost entrance. Such passive
      collection methods would greatly reduce the cost of sample collection by allowing
      more sites or roosts to be surveyed with a fraction of trained personnel, time,
      and effort investments needed.

TI  - Seasonal dynamics alter taxonomical and functional microbial profiles in Pampa
      biome soils under natural grasslands.
PG  - e4991
LID - 10.7717/peerj.4991 [doi]
AB  - Soil microbial communities' assembly is strongly tied to changes in temperature
      and moisture. Although microbial functional redundancy seems to overcome
      taxonomical composition changes, the sensitivity and resilience of soil microbial
      communities from subtropical regions in response to seasonal variations are still
      poorly understood. Thus, the development of new strategies for biodiversity
      conservation and sustainable management require a complete understanding of the
      soil abiotic process involved in the selection of microbial taxa and functions.
      In this work, we used state of the art molecular methodologies (Next Generation
      Sequencing) to compare the taxonomic (metataxonomics) and functional
      (metatranscriptomics) profiles among soil samples from two subtropical natural
      grasslands located in the Pampa biome, Brazil, in response to short-term seasonal
      variations. Our data suggest that grasslands maintained a stable microbial
      community membership along the year with oscillation in abundance. Apparently
      soil microbial taxa are more susceptible to natural climatic disturbances while
      functions are more stable and change with less intensity along the year. Finally,
      our data allow us to conclude that the most abundant microbial groups and
      functions were shared between seasons and locations reflecting the existence of a
      stable taxonomical and functional core microbiota.

TI  - Interpopulation Variation in the Atlantic Salmon Microbiome Reflects
      Environmental and Genetic Diversity.
LID - e00691-18 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00691-18 [doi]
AB  - The microbiome has a crucial influence on host phenotype and is of broad interest
      to ecological and evolutionary research. Yet, the extent of variation that occurs
      in the microbiome within and between populations is unclear. We characterized the
      skin and gut microbiomes of seven populations of juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo 
      salar) inhabiting a diverse range of environments, including hatchery-reared and 
      wild populations. We found shared skin operational taxonomic units (OTUs) across 
      all populations and core gut microbiota for all wild fish, but the diversity and 
      structure of both skin and gut microbial communities were distinct between
      populations. There was a marked difference between the gut microbiomes of wild
      and captive fish. Hatchery-reared fish had lower intestinal microbial diversity, 
      lacked core microbiota found in wild fish, and showed altered community structure
      and function. Skin and gut microbiomes were also less varied within captive
      populations, reflecting more uniform artificial rearing conditions. The
      surrounding water influenced the microbiome of the gut and, especially, the skin,
      but could not explain the degree of variation observed between populations. For
      both gut and skin, we found that there was greater difference in microbiome
      structures between more genetically distinct fish populations, and that
      population genetic diversity was positively correlated with microbiome diversity.
      However, diet is likely to be the major factor contributing to the large
      differences in gut microbiota between wild and captive fish. Our results
      highlight the scope of interpopulation variation in the Atlantic salmon
      microbiome and offer insights into the deterministic factors contributing to
      microbiome diversity and structure.IMPORTANCE Variation in the microbiome has a
      fundamental influence on host health, ecology, and evolution, but the scope and
      basis of this variation are not fully understood. We identified considerable
      variation in skin and gut microbial communities between seven wild and captive
      populations of Atlantic salmon, reflecting divergent environmental conditions and
      fish genetic diversity. In particular, we found very pronounced differences in
      the intestinal microbiomes of wild and hatchery-reared fish, likely reflecting
      differences in diet. Our results offer an insight into how the microbiome
      potentially contributes to the generation of local adaptations in this species
      and how domestication alters intestinal microbial communities, highlighting
      future research directions in these areas.

TI  - The queen's gut refines with age: longevity phenotypes in a social insect model.
PG  - 108
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0489-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In social insects, identical genotypes can show extreme lifespan
      variation providing a unique perspective on age-associated microbial succession. 
      In honey bees, short- and long-lived host phenotypes are polarized by a suite of 
      age-associated factors including hormones, nutrition, immune senescence, and
      oxidative stress. Similar to other model organisms, the aging gut microbiota of
      short-lived (worker) honey bees accrue Proteobacteria and are depleted of
      Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, consistent with a suite of host senescence
      markers. In contrast, long-lived (queen) honey bees maintain youthful cellular
      function with much lower expression of oxidative stress genes, suggesting a very 
      different host environment for age-associated microbial succession. RESULTS: We
      sequenced the microbiota of 63 honey bee queens exploring two chronological ages 
      and four alimentary tract niches. To control for genetic and environmental
      variation, we quantified carbonyl accumulation in queen fat body tissue as a
      proxy for biological aging. We compared our results to the age-specific microbial
      succession of worker guts. Accounting for queen source variation, two or more
      bacterial species per niche differed significantly by queen age. Biological aging
      in queens was correlated with microbiota composition highlighting the
      relationship of microbiota with oxidative stress. Queens and workers shared many 
      major gut bacterial species, but differ markedly in community structure and age
      succession. In stark contrast to aging workers, carbonyl accumulation in queens
      was significantly associated with increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and
      depletion of various Proteobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: We present a model system
      linking changes in gut microbiota to diet and longevity, two of the most
      confounding variables in human microbiota research. The pattern of age-associated
      succession in the queen microbiota is largely the reverse of that demonstrated
      for workers. The guts of short-lived worker phenotypes are progressively
      dominated by three major Proteobacteria, but these same species were sparse or
      significantly depleted in long-lived queen phenotypes. More broadly, age-related 
      changes in the honey bee microbiota reflect the regulatory anatomy of
      reproductive host metabolism. Our synthesis suggests that the evolution of
      colony-level reproductive physiology formed the context for host-microbial
      interactions and age-related succession of honey bee microbiota.

      with changing bacterial community structure under field conditions.
PG  - 2639-2651
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.14289 [doi]
AB  - The extraradical hyphae of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) harbour and
      interact with a microbial community performing multiple functions. However, how
      the AMF-microbiome interaction influences the phosphorus (P) acquisition
      efficiency of the mycorrhizal pathway is unclear. Here we investigated whether
      AMF and their hyphal microbiome play a role in promoting organic phosphorus (P)
      mineralizing under field conditions. We developed an AMF hyphae in-growth core
      system for the field using PVC tubes sealed with membrane with different size of 
      pores (30 or 0.45 mum) to allow or deny AMF hyphae access to a patch of organic P
      in root-free soil. AMF and their hyphae associated microbiome played a role in
      enhancing soil organic P mineralization in situ in the field, which was shown to 
      be a function of the change in bacteria community on the hyphae surface. The
      bacterial communities attached to the AMF hyphae surface were significantly
      different from those in the bulk soil. Importantly, AMF hyphae recruited bacteria
      that produced alkaline phosphatase and provided a function that was absent from
      the hyphae. These results demonstrate the importance of understanding trophic
      interactions to be able to gain insight into the functional controls of nutrient 
      cycles in the rhizosphere.

AB  - SRA Dose-Response and Microbial Risk Analysis Specialty Groups jointly sponsored 
      symposia that addressed the intersections between the "microbiome revolution" and
      dose response. Invited speakers presented on innovations and advances in gut and 
      nasal microbiota (normal microbial communities) in the first decade after the
      Human Microbiome Project began. The microbiota and their metabolites are now
      known to influence health and disease directly and indirectly, through modulation
      of innate and adaptive immune systems and barrier function. Disruption of healthy
      microbiota is often associated with changes in abundance and diversity of core
      microbial species (dysbiosis), caused by stressors including antibiotics,
      chemotherapy, and disease. Nucleic-acid-based metagenomic methods demonstrated
      that the dysbiotic host microbiota no longer provide normal colonization
      resistance to pathogens, a critical component of innate immunity of the
      superorganism. Diverse pathogens, probiotics, and prebiotics were considered in
      human and animal models (in vivo and in vitro). Discussion included approaches
      for design of future microbial dose-response studies to account for the presence 
      of the indigenous microbiota that provide normal colonization resistance, and the
      absence of the protective microbiota in dysbiosis. As NextGen risk analysis
      methodology advances with the "microbiome revolution," a proposed new framework, 
      the Health Triangle, may replace the old paradigm based on the Disease Triangle
      (focused on host, pathogen, and environment) and germophobia. Collaborative
      experimental designs are needed for testing hypotheses about causality in
      dose-response relationships for pathogens present in our environments that
      clearly compete in complex ecosystems with thousands of bacterial species
      dominating the healthy superorganism.

TI  - Soil pH Is the Primary Factor Correlating With Soil Microbiome in Karst Rocky
      Desertification Regions in the Wushan County, Chongqing, China.
PG  - 1027
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.01027 [doi]
AB  - Karst rocky desertification (KRD) is a process of land degradation, which causes 
      desert-like landscapes, deconstruction of endemic biomass, and declined soil
      quality. The relationship of KRD progression with above-ground communities (e.g. 
      vegetation and animal) is well-studied. Interaction of soil desertification with 
      underground communities, such as soil microbiome, however, is vastly unknown.
      This study characterizes change in soil bacterial community in response to KRD
      progression. Soil bacterial communities were surveyed by deep sequencing of 16S
      amplicons. Eight soil properties, pH, soil organic matter (SOM), total and
      available nitrogen (TN and AN), total and available phosphorus (TP and AP), and
      total and available potassium (TK and AK), were measured to assess soil quality. 
      We find that the overall soil quality decreases along with KRD progressive
      gradient. Soil bacterial community compositions are distinguishingly different in
      KRD stages. The richness and diversity in bacterial community do not
      significantly change with KRD progression although a slight increase in diversity
      was observed. A slight decrease in richness was seen in SKRD areas. Soil pH
      primarily correlates with bacterial community composition. We identified a core
      microbiome for KRD soils consisting of; Acidobacteria, Alpha-Proteobacteria,
      Planctomycetes, Beta-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes,
      Delta-Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Nitrospirae, and
      Gemmatimonadetes in this study. Phylum Cyanobacteria is significantly abundant in
      non-degraded soils, suggesting that Cyanobacterial activities might be correlated
      to soil quality. Our results suggest that Proteobacteria are sensitive to changes
      in soil properties caused by the KRD progression. Alpha- and beta-Proteobacteria 
      significantly predominated in SKRD compared to NKRD, suggesting that
      Proteobacteria, along with many others in the core microbiome (Acidobacteria,
      Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Nitrospirae), were active in nutrient limiting
      degraded soils. This study demonstrates the relationship of soil properties with 
      bacterial community in KRD areas. Our results fill the gap of knowledge on change
      in soil bacterial community during KRD progression.

TI  - Effect of Limit-Fed Diets With Different Forage to Concentrate Ratios on Fecal
      Bacterial and Archaeal Community Composition in Holstein Heifers.
PG  - 976
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00976 [doi]
AB  - Limit-feeding of a high concentrate diet has been proposed as an effective method
      for improving feed efficiency and reducing total manure output of dairy heifers; 
      meanwhile the effects of this method on hindgut microbiota are still unclear.
      This study investigated the effects of a wide range of dietary forage:concentrate
      ratios (F:C) on the fecal composition of bacteria and archaea in heifers using
      next-generation sequencing. Four diets with different F:C (80:20, 60:40, 40:60,
      and 20:80) were limit-fed to 24 Holstein heifers, and the fecal fermentation
      parameters and bacterial and archaeal communities were investigated. With
      increasing dietary concentrate levels, the fecal dry matter output, neutral
      detergent fiber (NDF) content, and proportion of acetate decreased linearly (P < 
      0.01), while the fecal starch content and proportions of propionate, butyrate,
      and total branched-chain volatile fatty acids (TBCVFAs) were increased (P </=
      0.05). An increased concentrate level linearly increased (P = 0.02) the relative 
      abundance of Proteobacteria, and linearly decreased (P = 0.02) the relative
      abundance of Bacteroidetes in feces. At the genus level, the relative abundance
      of unclassified Ruminococcaceae and Paludibacter which may have the potential to 
      degrade forage decreased linearly (q </= 0.02) with increasing dietary
      concentrate levels, while the relative abundance of Roseburia and Succinivibrio
      which may be non-fibrous carbohydrate degrading bacteria increased linearly (q
      </= 0.05). Some core microbiota operational taxonomic units (OTUs) also showed
      significant association with fecal VFAs, NDF, and/or acid detergent fiber (ADF)
      content. Meanwhile, the relative abundance of most detected taxa in archaea were 
      similar across different F:C, and only Methanosphaera showed a linear decrease (P
      = 0.01) in high concentrate diets. Our study provides a better understanding of
      fecal fermentation parameters and microbiota under a wide range of dietary F:C.
      These findings support the potential for microbial manipulation by diet, which
      could enhance feed digestibility and relieve environmental problems associated
      with heifer rearing.

TI  - Exposures Related to House Dust Microbiota in a U.S. Farming Population.
PG  - 067001
LID - 10.1289/EHP3145 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental factors can influence the house dust microbiota, which 
      may impact health outcomes. Little is known about how farming exposures impact
      the indoor microbiota. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify exposures related to
      bacterial communities in house dust in a U.S. farming population. METHODS: We
      used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize bacterial communities in
      vacuumed dust samples from the bedrooms of a subset of 879 households of farmers 
      and farmers' spouses enrolled in the Agricultural Lung Health Study (ALHS), a
      case-control study of asthma nested within the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) in
      North Carolina and Iowa. Information on current farming (past 12 mo), including
      both crop and animal farming, and other potential microbial sources was obtained 
      via questionnaires. We used linear regression to evaluate associations between
      exposures and bacterial diversity within each sample, analysis of similarity
      (ANOSIM), and permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) to
      identify exposures related to diversity between samples, and analysis of
      composition of microbiome to examine whether exposures related to diversity were 
      also related to differential abundance of specific operational taxonomic units
      (OTUs). RESULTS: Current farming was positively associated with bacterial
      diversity in house dust, with or without adjustment for nonfarm exposures related
      to diversity, including presence of indoor pets, home condition, and season of
      dust collection. Many taxa exhibited differential abundance related to farming.
      Some taxa in the phyla Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia were associated [false
      discovery rate (FDR)<0.05] with farming but not with other nonfarm factors. Many 
      taxa correlated with the concentration of house dust of endotoxin, commonly
      studied as a general marker of exposure to the farming environment. CONCLUSIONS: 
      In this farming population, house dust microbiota differed by current farming
      status. Understanding the determinants of the indoor microbiota is the first step
      toward understanding potential relationships with health outcomes.

AB  - The emission of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) can occur during
      biological nutrient removal. Denitrifying enhanced biological phosphorus removal 
      (d-EBPR) systems are an efficient means of removing phosphate and nitrogen,
      performed by denitrifying polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (d-PAOs). The aim 
      of this work was to study the effect of various combinations of electron
      acceptors, nitrate (NO3(-)), nitrite (NO2(-)), and N2O, on the denitrification
      pathway of a d-EBPR system. Batch tests were performed with different electron
      acceptor combinations, to explore the denitrification pathway. Reverse
      transcriptase-qPCR (RT-qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing, combined with
      chemical analysis, were used to study gene expression, microbial diversity, and
      denitrification kinetics. The potential for N2O production was greater than the
      potential for its reduction in most tests. A strong correlation was observed
      between the N2O reduction rate and the relative gene expression of nitrous oxide 
      reductase per nitrite reductase (nosZ/(nirS + nirK)), suggesting that the
      expression of denitrifying marker genes is a strong predictor of the N2O
      reduction rate. The d-EBPR community maintained a core population with low
      variations throughout the study. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the
      studied marker genes revealed that the organisms actively involved in
      denitrification were closely related to Thauera sp., Candidatus Accumulibacter
      phosphatis, and Candidatus Competibacter denitrificans. Moreover,
      Competibacter-related OTUs seem to be important contributors to the N2O reduction
      capacity of the system, likely scavenging the N2O produced by other organisms.
      Overall, this study contributes to a better understanding of the microbial
      biochemistry and the genetics involving biological denitrification removal,
      important to minimize N2O emissions in wastewater treatment plants.

AB  - The impact of the starting inoculum on long-term anaerobic digestion performance,
      process functionality and microbial community composition remains unclear. To
      understand the impact of starting inoculum, active microbial communities from
      four different full-scale anaerobic digesters were each used to inoculate four
      continuous lab-scale anaerobic digesters, which were operated identically for 295
      days. Digesters were operated at 15 days solid retention time, an organic loading
      rate of 1g COD Lr(-1) d(-1) (75:25 - cellulose:casein) and 37 degrees C. Results 
      showed that long-term process performance, metabolic rates (hydrolytic,
      acetogenic, and methanogenic) and microbial community are independent of the
      inoculum source. Digesters process performance converged after 80 days, while
      metabolic rates and microbial communities converged after 120-145 days. The
      convergence of the different microbial communities towards a core-community
      proves that the deterministic factors (process operational conditions) were a
      stronger driver than the initial microbial community composition. Indeed, the
      core-community represented 72% of the relative abundance among the four
      digesters. Moreover, a number of positive correlations were observed between
      higher metabolic rates and the relative abundance of specific microbial groups.
      These correlations showed that both substrate consumers and suppliers trigger
      higher metabolic rates, expanding the knowledge of the nexus between
      microorganisms and functionality. Overall, these results support that
      deterministic factors control microbial communities in bioreactors independently 
      of the inoculum source. Hence, it seems plausible that a desired microbial
      composition and functionality can be achieved by tuning process operational
      conditions.

TI  - Diet breadth and exploitation of exotic plants shift the core microbiome of
      Cephaloleia, a group of tropical herbivorous beetles.
PG  - e4793
LID - 10.7717/peerj.4793 [doi]
AB  - The beetle genus Cephaloleia has evolved in association with tropical ginger
      plants and for many species their specific host plant associations are known.
      Here we show that the core microbiome of six closely related Costa Rican
      Cephaloleia species comprises only eight bacterial groups, including members of
      the Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriacea, Pseudomonas, Lactococcus, and Comamonas.
      The Acinetobacter and Enterobacteriacea together accounted for 35% of the total
      average 16S rRNA ribotypes recovered from all specimens. Further, microbiome
      diversity and community structure was significantly linked to beetle diet
      breadth, between those foraging on less than two plant types (specialists) versus
      over nine plant types (generalists). Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and
      Pseudomonadaceae were highly prevalent in specialist species, and also present in
      eggs, while Rickettsiaceae associated exclusively with generalist beetles.
      Bacteria isolated from Cephaloleia digestive systems had distinct capabilities
      and suggested a possible beneficial role in both digestion of plant-based
      compounds, including xylose, mannitol, and pectin, and possible detoxification,
      via lipases. Cephaloleia species are currently expanding their diets to include
      exotic invasive plants, yet it is unknown whether their microbial community plays
      a role in this transition. In this study, colonization of invasive plants was
      correlated with a dysbiosis of the microbiome, suggesting a possible relationship
      between gut bacteria and niche adaptation.

      trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) midgut and faeces.

LID - 10.1242/bio.034397 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the impact of different dietary ingredients, with
      different protein/lipid sources, on midgut and faeces bacteria community
      structures just before feeding and 3 h after feeding a single meal to individual 
      rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Fish were kept in experimental rearing
      facilities and fed ad libitum twice daily for 5 weeks. Fish were fed three
      different commercial diets, which contained variations of high or low marine
      fishmeal/fish oil content. DNA was extracted from midgut and faeces samples for
      analysis of their bacterial 16S rRNA gene diversity by targeting the V3-V4 region
      with 454 pyrosequencing. A total of 332 unique bacterial operational taxonomic
      units (OTUs) were revealed in all samples. However, each sample was dominated
      (>80% relative abundance) by 2-14 OTUs, with the single most dominant OTU having 
      >30% dominance, indicating that only a few bacteria were fundamental in terms of 
      relative abundance in each treatment. Fifteen OTUs occurred in all samples (core 
      microbiota). The majority of these OTUs belonged to the Proteobacteria,
      Firmicutes or Tenericutes, and were associated with other animal gut
      environments. The faecal material and the midgut samples had few overlaps in
      their shared OTUs. A postprandial response in the gut bacterial community
      structure 3 h after feeding highlights how dietary stimulation induces structural
      changes in the microbiota profiles in the established gut bacteria. This study
      showed that feeding O. mykiss different diets and even single meals lead to
      perturbations in the established gut bacteria of O. mykiss.

TI  - Stable and Enriched Cenarchaeum symbiosum and Uncultured Betaproteobacteria HF1
      in the Microbiome of the Mediterranean Sponge Haliclona fulva (Demospongiae:
      Haplosclerida).
PG  - 25-36
LID - 10.1007/s00248-018-1201-5 [doi]
AB  - Sponges harbor characteristic microbiomes derived from symbiotic relationships
      shaping their lifestyle and survival. Haliclona fulva is encrusting marine sponge
      species dwelling in coralligenous accretions or semidark caves of the
      Mediterranean Sea and the near Atlantic Ocean. In this work, we characterized the
      abundance and core microbial community composition found in specimens of H. fulva
      by means of electron microscopy and 16S amplicon Illumina sequencing. We provide 
      evidence of its low microbial abundance (LMA) nature. We found that the H. fulva 
      core microbiome is dominated by sequences belonging to the orders
      Nitrosomonadales and Cenarchaeales. Seventy percent of the reads assigned to
      these phylotypes grouped in a very small number of high-frequency operational
      taxonomic units, representing niche-specific species Cenarchaeum symbiosum and
      uncultured Betaproteobacteria HF1, a new eubacterial ribotype variant found in H.
      fulva. The microbial composition of H. fulva is quite distinct from those
      reported in sponge species of the same Haliclona genus. We also detected evidence
      of an excretion/capturing loop between these abundant microorganisms and
      planktonic microbes by analyzing shifts in seawater planktonic microbial content 
      exposed to healthy sponge specimens maintained in aquaria. Our results suggest
      that horizontal transmission is very likely the main mechanism for symbionts'
      acquisition by H. fulva. So far, this is the first shallow water sponge species
      harboring such a specific and predominant assemblage composed of these
      eubacterial and archaeal ribotypes. Our data suggests that this symbiotic
      relationship is very stable over time, indicating that the identified core
      microbial symbionts may play key roles in the holobiont functioning.

TI  - Low-abundant bacteria drive compositional changes in the gut microbiota after
      dietary alteration.
PG  - 86
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0469-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the importance of beneficial bacteria is better recognized,
      understanding the dynamics of symbioses becomes increasingly crucial. In many gut
      symbioses, it is essential to understand whether changes in host diet play a role
      in the persistence of the bacterial gut community. In this study, termites were
      fed six dietary sources and the microbial community was monitored over a 49-day
      period using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A deep backpropagation artificial neural
      network (ANN) was used to learn how the six different lignocellulose food sources
      affected the temporal composition of the hindgut microbiota of the termite as
      well as taxon-taxon and taxon-substrate interactions. RESULTS: Shifts in the
      termite gut microbiota after diet change in each colony were observed using 16S
      rRNA gene sequencing and beta diversity analyses. The artificial neural network
      accurately predicted the relative abundances of taxa at random points in the
      temporal study and showed that low-abundant taxa maintain community driving
      correlations in the hindgut. CONCLUSIONS: This combinatorial approach utilizing
      16S rRNA gene sequencing and deep learning revealed that low-abundant bacteria
      that often do not belong to the core community are drivers of the termite hindgut
      bacterial community composition.

TI  - Agricultural Freshwater Pond Supports Diverse and Dynamic Bacterial and Viral
      Populations.

AB  - Agricultural ponds have a great potential as a means of capture and storage of
      water for irrigation. However, pond topography (small size, shallow depth) leaves
      them susceptible to environmental, agricultural, and anthropogenic exposures that
      may influence microbial dynamics. Therefore, the aim of this project was to
      characterize the bacterial and viral communities of pond water in the
      Mid-Atlantic United States with a focus on the late season (October-December),
      where decreasing temperature and nutrient levels can affect the composition of
      microbial communities. Ten liters of freshwater from an agricultural pond were
      sampled monthly, and filtered sequentially through 1 and 0.2 mum filter
      membranes. Total DNA was then extracted from each filter, and the bacterial
      communities were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The remaining
      filtrate was chemically concentrated for viruses, DNA-extracted, and shotgun
      sequenced. Bacterial community profiling showed significant fluctuations over the
      sampling period, corresponding to changes in the condition of the pond freshwater
      (e.g., pH, nutrient load). In addition, there were significant differences in the
      alpha-diversity and core bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between
      water fractions filtered through different pore sizes. The viral fraction was
      dominated by tailed bacteriophage of the order Caudovirales, largely those of the
      Siphoviridae family. Moreover, while present, genes involved in
      virulence/antimicrobial resistance were not enriched within the viral fraction
      during the study period. Instead, the viral functional profile was dominated by
      phage associated proteins, as well as those related to nucleotide production.
      Overall, these data suggest that agricultural pond water harbors a diverse core
      of bacterial and bacteriophage species whose abundance and composition are
      influenced by environmental variables characteristic of pond topology and the
      late season.

AB  - The main goal of modern microbial ecology is to determine the key factors
      influencing the global diversity of microorganisms. Because of their complexity, 
      soil communities are largely underexplored in this context. We studied soil
      genesis (combination of various soil-forming processes, specific to a particular 
      soil type) that is driven by microbial activity. To investigate the interrelation
      between soil type and microbial diversity, we analyzed six soil types that are
      common in Russia, the Crimea, and Kazakhstan using 16S rDNA pyrosequencing. Soils
      of different types varied in the taxonomic composition of microbial communities. 
      Their core microbiomes comprised 47 taxa within the orders Solirubrobacteriales
      and Hyphomicrobiaceae and the Gaiellaceae family. Two species from
      Bradyrhizobiaceae and Solirubrobactriaceae were present in all samples, whereas
      most other taxa were soil-type specific. Multiple resampling analysis revealed
      that two random soil samples from the same soil type shared more taxa than two
      samples from different types. The differences in community composition were
      mostly affected by the variation in pH values and exchangeable potassium content.
      The results show that data on the soil microbiome could be used for soil
      identification and clarification of their taxonomic position.

TI  - Core microbiomes for sustainable agroecosystems.
PG  - 247-257
LID - 10.1038/s41477-018-0139-4 [doi]
AB  - In an era of ecosystem degradation and climate change, maximizing microbial
      functions in agroecosystems has become a prerequisite for the future of global
      agriculture. However, managing species-rich communities of plant-associated
      microbiomes remains a major challenge. Here, we propose interdisciplinary
      research strategies to optimize microbiome functions in agroecosystems.
      Informatics now allows us to identify members and characteristics of 'core
      microbiomes', which may be deployed to organize otherwise uncontrollable dynamics
      of resident microbiomes. Integration of microfluidics, robotics and machine
      learning provides novel ways to capitalize on core microbiomes for increasing
      resource-efficiency and stress-resistance of agroecosystems.

PG  - 346-355
LID - 10.1007/s12275-018-7486-8 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbial diversity and the core microbiota of the Jinhua pig, which is a
      traditional, slow-growing Chinese breed with a high body-fat content, were
      examined from a total of 105 fecal samples collected from 6 groups of pigs at 3
      weaning ages that originated from 2 strains and were raised on 3 different pig
      farms. The bacterial community was analyzed following high-throughput
      pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes, and the fecal concentrations of short-chain
      fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured by gas chromatograph. Our results showed that
      Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla, and Lactobacillus,
      Streptococcus, Clostridium, SMB53, and Bifidobacterium were the most abundant
      genera. Fifteen predominant genera present in every Jinhua pig sample constituted
      a phylogenetic core microbiota and included the probiotics Lactobacillus and
      Bifidobacterium, and the SCFA-producing bacteria Clostridium, Prevotella,
      Bacteroides, Coprococcus, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Blautia, and Butyricicoccus.
      Comparisons of the microbiota compositions and SCFA concentrations across the 6
      groups of pigs demonstrated that genetic background and weaning age affected the 
      structure of the gut microbiota more significantly than the farm. The relative
      abundance of the core genera in the pigs, including Lactobacillus, Clostridium,
      Prevotella, Bacteroides, Roseburia, Ruminococcus, Blautia, and Butyricicoccus
      varied dramatically in pigs among the 2 origins and 3 weaning ages, while
      Oscillospira, Megasphaera, Parabacteroides, and Corynebacterium differed among
      pigs from different farms. Interestingly, there was a more significant influence 
      of strain and weaning age than of rearing farm on the SCFA concentrations.
      Therefore, strain and weaning age appear to be the more important factors shaping
      the intestinal microbiome of pigs.

PG  - 337-345
LID - 10.1007/s12275-018-7438-3 [doi]
AB  - As an ancient seed plant, cycads are one of the few gymnosperms that develop a
      root symbiosis with cyanobacteria, which has allowed cycads to cope with harsh
      geologic and climatic conditions during the evolutionary process. However, the
      endophytic microbes in cycad roots remain poorly identified. In this study, using
      next-generation sequencing techniques, we investigated the microbial diversity
      and composition of both the coralloid and regular roots of Cycas bifida (Dyer)
      K.D. Hill. Highly diverse endophytic communities were observed in both the
      coralloid and regular roots. Of the associated bacteria, the top five families
      were the Nostocaceae, Sinobacteraceae, Bradyrhizobiaceae, Bacillaceae, and
      Hyphomicrobiaceae. The Nectriaceae, Trichocomaceae, and Incertae sedis were the
      predominant fungal families in all root samples. A significant difference in the 
      endophytic bacterial community was detected between coralloid roots and regular
      roots, but no difference was observed between the fungal communities in the two
      root types. Cyanobacteria were more dominant in coralloid roots than in regular
      roots. The divergence of cycad root structures and the modified physiological
      processes may have contributed to the abundance of cyanobionts in coralloid
      roots. Consequently, the colonization of cyanobacteria inhibits the assemblage of
      other endophytes. Our results contribute to an understanding of the species
      diversity and composition of the cycad-endophyte microbiome and provide an
      abbreviated list of potential ecological roles of the core microbes present.

AB  - Although colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of death in Morocco, there 
      are no studies of the microbiome changes associated with the disease in the
      Moroccan population. The aim of our study was to compare the stool microbiome of 
      Moroccan cancer patients with healthy individuals. We analyzed the microbiome
      composition of samples from 11 CRC patients and 12 healthy individuals by 16S
      rRNA amplicon sequencing. Principal coordinate analysis of samples revealed
      defined cancer versus healthy clusters. Our findings showed that cancer samples
      had higher proportions of Firmicutes (T = 50.5%; N = 28.4%; p = 0.04),
      specifically of Clostridia (T = 48.3%; N = 19.0%; p = 0.002), and Fusobacteria (T
      = 0.1%; N = 0.0%; p = 0.02), especially of Fusobacteriia (T = 0.1%; N = 0.0%; p =
      0.02), while Bacteroidetes were enriched in healthy samples (T = 35.1%; N =
      62.8%; p = 0.06), particularly the class Bacteroidia (T = 35.1%; N = 62.6%; p =
      0.06). Porphyromonas, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, Selenomonas, and Fusobacterium
      were significantly overrepresented in diseased patients, similarly to other
      studies. Predicted functional information showed that bacterial motility
      proteins, flagellar assembly, and fatty acid biosynthesis metabolism were
      significantly overrepresented in cancer patients, while amino acid metabolism and
      glycan biosynthesis were overrepresented in controls. This suggests that
      involvement of these functional metagenomes is similar and relevant in the
      carcinogenesis process, independent of the origin of the samples. Results from
      this study allowed identification of bacterial taxa relevant to the Moroccan
      population and encourages larger studies to facilitate population-directed
      therapeutic approaches.

      Potential in Streams Impacted by Hydraulic Fracturing.
PG  - 5989-5999
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.8b00239 [doi]
AB  - The environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, particularly those of surface 
      spills in aquatic ecosystems, are not fully understood. The goals of this study
      were to (1) understand the effect of previous exposure to hydraulic fracturing
      fluids on aquatic microbial community structure and (2) examine the impacts
      exposure has on biodegradation potential of the biocide glutaraldehyde.
      Microcosms were constructed from hydraulic fracturing-impacted and nonhydraulic
      fracturing-impacted streamwater within the Marcellus shale region in
      Pennsylvania. Microcosms were amended with glutaraldehyde and incubated
      aerobically for 56 days. Microbial community adaptation to glutaraldehyde was
      monitored using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantification by qPCR.
      Abiotic and biotic glutaraldehyde degradation was measured using
      ultra-performance liquid chromatography--high resolution mass spectrometry and
      total organic carbon. It was found that nonhydraulic fracturing-impacted
      microcosms biodegraded glutaraldehyde faster than the hydraulic
      fracturing-impacted microcosms, showing a decrease in degradation potential after
      exposure to hydraulic fracturing activity. Hydraulic fracturing-impacted
      microcosms showed higher richness after glutaraldehyde exposure compared to
      unimpacted streams, indicating an increased tolerance to glutaraldehyde in
      hydraulic fracturing impacted streams. Beta diversity and differential abundance 
      analysis of sequence count data showed different bacterial enrichment for
      hydraulic fracturing-impacted and nonhydraulic fracturing-impacted microcosms
      after glutaraldehyde addition. These findings demonstrated a lasting effect on
      microbial community structure and glutaraldehyde degradation potential in streams
      impacted by hydraulic fracturing operations.

TI  - Dynamic Alterations in Salivary Microbiota Related to Dental Caries and Age in
      Preschool Children With Deciduous Dentition: A 2-Year Follow-Up Study.
PG  - 342
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2018.00342 [doi]
AB  - Dynamic alterations in oral microbiota are closely related to the development of 
      dental caries;however, changes in salivary microbiota during this process have
      not been extensively studied. In addition, increasing evidence suggests that oral
      microbiome profiles differ according to dentition stages, but it is unclear
      whether they change with age during the same dentition, such as deciduous
      dentition. These two aspects were investigated in a 2-year follow-up study, and
      caries-free preschool children with complete deciduous dentition were enrolled.
      Saliva was collected and oral examination was conducted at the beginning of this 
      trial, and then every subsequent 6 months for a total of five time points (T0,
      T1, T2, T3, and T4). Based on the clinical examination of teeth at the end of the
      trial, subjects were divided into health-to-health (H-H, N = 11) and
      health-to-caries (H-C, N = 12) groups at every time point. A total of 115 saliva 
      samples from 23 subjects was detected by sequencing 16S rDNA V3-V4 hypervariable 
      regions with the Illumina MiSeq platform to obtain microbiome profiles, and 100
      samples finally passed quality control for further analyses. A total of 4,328,852
      high-quality sequencing reads passed quality-control testing, representing 14
      phyla, 27 classes, 43 orders, 67 families, and 127 genera. An alpha diversity
      analysis showed that salivary microbial diversity was similar in all groups, and 
      a beta diversity analysis showed that salivary microbial community structure
      changed with dental caries. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe)
      analysis revealed that the abundance of the genera Atopobium, Megasphaera, and
      Veillonella increased significantly, while that of the genera Shuttleworthia and 
      Rothia decreased significantly with the development of dental caries. Megasphaera
      and Veillonella were enriched at the early stage of deciduous dentition whereas
      Peptococcus, Rothia, and Treponema were enriched at the later stage. The core
      microbiome in the H-H and H-C groups comprised 26 and 29 genera, respectively,
      with statistical differences observed in 11 shared core genera. These results
      provide new insights into variations in the salivary microbiome related to dental
      caries and age in the deciduous dentition period.

AB  - Balanced bacterial communities within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of animals 
      are a key component of gut health, resulting in optimal performance and the
      prevention of disease. The purpose of this study was to characterize the
      commercial pig's baseline bacterial microbiome over time and across anatomical
      site. Several anatomical sites (duodenum/jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon) were
      examined across multiple ages (days 0, 10, 21, 33, 62, 84, and market) for
      bacterial microbiome structure using 16S rRNA V4 region sequencing with Illumina 
      MiSeq. General trends in the succession of the bacterial microbiome were observed
      over age, such as increasing populations of Clostridia and decreasing populations
      of Gammaproteobacteria (P < 0.05). However, apparent disruptions in the
      microbiome were also observed that did not follow these trends, specifically at
      sampling 24 h post-weaning where Lactobacillaceae were drastically reduced in
      relative abundance (P < 0.05). The introduction of solid feed between days 21 and
      33 had the greatest overall impact on bacterial community structure as compared
      with the effects of age, changes in solid feed type, and pig movement. A core
      bacterial microbiome was identified across all anatomical sites consisting of the
      dominant operational taxonomic units (OTUs); samples were only differentiated
      based upon anatomical site when considering less abundant OTUs and differences in
      relative abundance. When considering mucosal vs. digesta samples from the cecum
      and ileum, several taxa were of significantly higher relative abundance in the
      mucosa (P < 0.05), including Anaerovibrio, Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio,
      Helicobacter, Oscillospira, Phascolarctobacterium, and Prevotella. Correlations
      between several genus-level taxa and pig weight were observed. Overall, this
      study provides an expanded view of the dynamic pig GI microbiome from farrow to
      finish.

TI  - Characterizing oral microbial communities across dentition states and
      colonization niches.
PG  - 67
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0443-2 [doi]
AB  - METHODS: The present study aimed to identify patterns and processes in
      acquisition of oral bacteria and to characterize the microbiota of different
      dentition states and habitats. Mucosal, salivary, supragingival, and subgingival 
      biofilm samples were collected from orally and systemically healthy children and 
      mother-child dyads in predentate, primary, mixed, and permanent dentitions. 16S
      rRNA gene sequences were compared to the Human Oral Microbiome Database (HOMD).
      Functional potential was inferred using PICRUSt. RESULTS: Unweighted and weighted
      UniFrac distances were significantly smaller between each mother-predentate dyad 
      than infant-unrelated female dyads. Predentate children shared a median of 85% of
      species-level operational taxonomic units (s-OTUs) and 100% of core s-OTUs with
      their mothers. Maternal smoking, but not gender, mode of delivery, feeding
      habits, or type of food discriminated between predentate microbial profiles. The 
      primary dentition demonstrated expanded community membership, structure, and
      function when compared to the predentate stage, as well as significantly lower
      similarity between mother-child dyads. The primary dentition also included 85% of
      predentate core s-OTUs. Subsequent dentitions exhibited over 90% similarity to
      the primary dentition in phylogenetic and functional structure. Species from the 
      predentate mucosa as well as new microbial assemblages were identified in the
      primary supragingival and subgingival microbiomes. All individuals shared 65% of 
      species between supragingival and subgingival habitats; however, the salivary
      microbiome exhibited less than 35% similarity to either habitat. CONCLUSIONS:
      Within the limitations of a cross-sectional study design, we identified two
      definitive stages in oral bacterial colonization: an early predentate imprinting 
      and a second wave with the eruption of primary teeth. Bacterial acquisition in
      the oral microbiome is influenced by the maternal microbiome. Personalization
      begins with the eruption of primary teeth; however, this is limited to phylogeny;
      functionally, individuals exhibit few differences, suggesting that microbial
      assembly may follow a defined schematic that is driven by the functional
      requirements of the ecosystem. This early microbiome forms the foundation upon
      which newer communities develop as more colonization niches emerge, and expansion
      of biodiversity is attributable to both introduction of new species and increase 
      in abundance of predentate organisms.

TI  - Metatranscriptomics analysis of mangroves habitats around Mauritius.
PG  - 59
LID - 10.1007/s11274-018-2442-7 [doi]
AB  - Mangroves are unique but endangered coastal ecosystems that play a vital role in 
      the tropical and subtropical environments. Mauritius has two species of
      mangroves, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (L.) Lam. and Rhizophora mucronata Lam., growing
      along its coast. The mangrove rhizosphere harbours a diverse microbial community 
      and the use of RNA-sequencing can reveal both the taxonomic composition and
      active biochemical functions of the complex microbial community.
      Metatranscriptomic study was carried out by comparing the microbial community of 
      rhizosphere microbiomes sediments from the two mangroves species. The study also 
      included a comparison between a natural and a man grown mangrove microbiome.
      Overall, samples showed predominance by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and
      Firmicutes, with high abundance of sulphate reducers, nitrogen reducers and
      methanogens. Significant difference was, however, noted at both taxonomic and
      functional levels among the mangroves species. The data also indicate that the
      microbial core involved in methane, nitrogen, and sulphur metabolism consisted
      mainly of Burkholderiaceae, Planctomycetaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and
      Desulfobacteraceae. Also, genes encoding enzymes involved in carbon cycling, the 
      metabolism of nitrogen, methane and sulphur were dominant in the rhizosphere of
      the natural mangrove ecosystem. To our knowledge, this is a first
      metatranscriptomic study on the microbiome of mangroves in the Mauritius, and our
      results provide the first insights in the range of functions and microbial
      diversity of the local mangrove species.

TI  - The direct and indirect association of cervical microbiota with the risk of
      cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
PG  - 2172-2179
LID - 10.1002/cam4.1471 [doi]
AB  - Cervical microbiota composition is associated with cervical HPV infection and CIN
      severity. Previous studies only assessed the total association between cervical
      microbiota and HPV infections or CINs, and yet no study reported the direct and
      indirect associations between cervical microbiota and CINs mediated by HPV
      infection, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct and 
      indirect associations between microbiotas and CIN severity. Cervical microbiota
      of 126 women with CIN 1- (normal cytology and CIN 1) and 40 with CIN 2+ (CIN 2
      and CIN 3) were analyzed using Illumina sequencing based on the 16S rRNA gene.
      HPV was detected using a highly sensitive PCR primer set (SPF1/GP6+). Indirect
      effects of Pseudomonas stutzeri, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii,
      Atopobium vaginae, and Streptococcus agalactiae mediated by HPV infection on CIN 
      status were observed. The directions of the direct and the indirect associations 
      between CIN status and Ps. stutzeri were opposite. The directions of the direct
      and the indirect associations between CIN status and A. vaginae were the same. B.
      fragilis, L. delbrueckii, and S. agalactiae only had indirect association with
      CIN status. In summary, our study provided suggestive evidence that some
      microbial populations could have direct or indirect effects mediated by affecting
      HPV infection on CIN progression. Besides HPV infection, microbial community
      composition possibly plays a role in cervical carcinogenesis.

TI  - Seasonal and algal diet-driven patterns of the digestive microbiota of the
      European abalone Haliotis tuberculata, a generalist marine herbivore.
PG  - 60
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0430-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Holobionts have a digestive microbiota with catabolic abilities
      allowing the degradation of complex dietary compounds for the host. In
      terrestrial herbivores, the digestive microbiota is known to degrade complex
      polysaccharides from land plants while in marine herbivores, the digestive
      microbiota is poorly characterized. Most of the latter are generalists and
      consume red, green, and brown macroalgae, three distinct lineages characterized
      by a specific composition in complex polysaccharides, which represent half of
      their biomass. Subsequently, each macroalga features a specific epiphytic
      microbiota, and the digestive microbiota of marine herbivores is expected to vary
      with a monospecific algal diet. We investigated the effect of four monospecific
      diets (Palmaria palmata, Ulva lactuca, Saccharina latissima, Laminaria digitata) 
      on the composition and specificity of the digestive microbiota of a generalist
      marine herbivore, the abalone, farmed in a temperate coastal area over a year.
      The microbiota from the abalone digestive gland was sampled every 2 months and
      explored using metabarcoding. RESULTS: Diversity and multivariate analyses showed
      that patterns of the microbiota were significantly linked to seasonal variations 
      of contextual parameters but not directly to a specific algal diet. Three core
      genera: Psychrilyobacter, Mycoplasma, and Vibrio constantly dominated the
      microbiota in the abalone digestive gland. Additionally, a less abundant and
      diet-specific core microbiota featured genera representing aerobic primary
      degraders of algal polysaccharides. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the
      establishment of a persistent core microbiota in the digestive gland of the
      abalone since its juvenile state and the presence of a less abundant and
      diet-specific core community. While composed of different microbial taxa compared
      to terrestrial herbivores, the digestive gland constitutes a particular niche in 
      the abalone holobiont, where bacteria (i) may cooperate to degrade algal
      polysaccharides to products assimilable by the host or (ii) may have acquired
      these functions through gene transfer from the aerobic algal microbiota.

TI  - The influence of host genotype and salt stress on the seed endophytic community
      of salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant rice cultivars.
PG  - 51

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inherent characteristics and changes in the physiology of rice as it 
      attains salt tolerance affect the colonizing bacterial endophytic communities of 
      the rice seeds. These transmissible endophytes also serve as a source of the
      plant's microbial community and concurrently respond to the host and
      environmental conditions. This study explores the influence of the rice host as
      well as the impact of soil salinity on the community structure and diversity of
      seed bacterial endophytes of rice with varying tolerance to salt stress.
      Endophytic bacterial diversity was studied through culture-dependent technique
      and Terminal-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. RESULTS:
      Results revealed considerably diverse communities of bacterial endophytes in the 
      interior of rice seeds. The overall endophytic bacterial communities of the
      indica rice seeds based on 16S rRNA analysis of clones and isolates are dominated
      by phylum Proteobacteria followed by Actinobacteria and Firmicutes. Community
      profiles show common ribotypes found in all cultivars of the indica subspecies
      representing potential core microbiota belonging to Curtobacterium,
      Flavobacterium, Enterobacter, Xanthomonas, Herbaspirillum, Microbacterium and
      Stenotrophomonas. Clustering analysis shows that the host genotype mainly
      influences the seed endophytic community of the different rice cultivars. Under
      salt stress conditions, endophytic communities of the salt-sensitive and
      salt-tolerant rice cultivars shift their dominance to bacterial groups belonging 
      to Flavobacterium, Pantoea, Enterobacter, Microbacterium, Kosakonia and
      Curtobacterium. CONCLUSION: The endophytic communities of rice indica seeds are
      shaped by the hosts' genotype, their physiological adaptation to salt stress and 
      phylogenetic relatedness. Under salt stress conditions, a few groups of bacterial
      communities become prominent causing a shift in bacterial diversity and
      dominance.

TI  - Unique Microbial Diversity and Metabolic Pathway Features of Fermented Vegetables
      From Hainan, China.
PG  - 399
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00399 [doi]
AB  - Fermented vegetables are typically traditional foods made of fresh vegetables and
      their juices, which are fermented by beneficial microorganisms. Herein, we
      applied high-throughput sequencing and culture-dependent technology to describe
      the diversities of microbiota and identify core microbiota in fermented
      vegetables from different areas of Hainan Province, and abundant metabolic
      pathways in the fermented vegetables were simultaneously predicted. At the genus 
      level, Lactobacillus bacteria were the most abundant. Lactobacillus plantarum was
      the most abundant species, followed by Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus
      pentosaceus, and Weissella cibaria. These species were present in each sample
      with average absolute content values greater than 1% and were thus defined as
      core microbiota. Analysis results based on the alpha and beta diversities of the 
      microbial communities showed that the microbial profiles of the fermented
      vegetables differed significantly based on the regions and raw materials used,
      and the species of the vegetables had a greater effect on the microbial community
      structure than the region from where they were harvested. Regarding microbial
      functional metabolism, we observed an enrichment of metabolic pathways, including
      membrane transport, replication and repair and translation, which implied that
      the microbial metabolism in the fermented vegetables tended to be vigorous. In
      addition, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum were calculated to 
      be major metabolic pathway contributors. Finally, we constructed a network to
      better explain correlations among the core microbiota and metabolic pathways.
      This study facilitates an understanding of the differences in microbial profiles 
      and fermentation pathways involved in the production of fermented vegetables,
      establishes a basis for optimally selecting microorganisms to manufacture
      high-quality fermented vegetable products, and lays the foundation for better
      utilizing tropical microbial resources.

TI  - Effect of exogenous inoculants on enhancing oil recovery and indigenous bacterial
      community dynamics in long-term field pilot of low permeability reservoir.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1007/s11274-018-2433-8 [doi]
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa DN1 strain and Bacillus subtilis QHQ110 strain were chosen
      as rhamnolipid and lipopeptide producer respectively, to evaluate the efficiency 
      of exogenous inoculants on enhancing oil recovery (EOR) and to explore the
      relationship between injected bacteria and indigenous bacterial community
      dynamics in long-term filed pilot of Hujianshan low permeability water-flooded
      reservoir for 26 months. Core-flooding tests showed that the oil displacement
      efficiency increased by 18.46% with addition of exogenous consortia. Bacterial
      community dynamics using quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing revealed
      that the exogenous inoculants survived and could live together with indigenous
      bacterial populations. They gradually became the dominant community after the
      initial activation, while their comparative advantage weakened continually after 
      3 months of the first injection. The bacterial populations did not exert an
      observable change in the process of the second injection of exogenous inoculants.
      On account of facilitating oil emulsification and accelerating bacterial growth
      with oil as the carbon source by the injection of exogenous consortia,
      gamma-proteobacteria was finally the prominent bacterial community at class level
      varying from 25.55 to 32.67%, and the dominant bacterial populations were
      increased by 2-3 orders of magnitude during the whole processes. The content of
      organic acids and rhamnolipids in reservoir were promoted with the change of
      bacterial community diversity, respectively. Cumulative oil increments reached
      26,190 barrels for 13 months after the first injection, and 55,947 barrels of oil
      had been accumulated in all of A20 wells block through two rounds of bacterial
      consortia injection. The performance of EOR has a cumulative improvement by the
      injection of exogenous inoculants without observable inhibitory effect on the
      indigenous bacterial populations, demonstrating the application potential in low 
      permeability water-flooded reservoirs.

AB  - Understanding diversity and assembly patterns of microbial communities in
      activated sludge (AS) is pivotal for addressing fundamental ecological questions 
      and wastewater treatment engineering. Recent applications of molecular methods
      especially high-throughput sequencing (HTS) have led to the explosion of
      information about AS community diversity, including the identification of
      uncultured taxa, and characterization of low-abundance but environmentally
      important populations such as antibiotic resistant bacteria and pathogens. Those 
      progresses have facilitated the leverage of ecological theories in describing AS 
      community assembly. The lognormal species abundance curve has been applied to
      estimate AS microbial richness. Taxa-area and taxa-time relationships (TAR and
      TTR) have been observed for AS microbial communities. Core AS microbial
      communities have been identified. Meanwhile, the roles of both deterministic and 
      stochastic processes in shaping AS community structures have been examined.
      Nonetheless, it remains challenging to define tempo-spatial scales for reliable
      identification of community turnover, and find tight links between AS microbial
      structure and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) functions. To solve those issues,
      we expect that future research will focus on identifying active functional
      populations in AS using omics- methods integrated with stable-isotope probing
      (SIP) with the development of bioinformatics tools. Developing mathematic models 
      to understand AS community structures and utilize information on AS community to 
      predict the performance of WWTPs will also be vital for advancing knowledge of AS
      microbial ecology and environmental engineering.

LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-22683-1 [doi]
AB  - To understand the seasonal variation of the activated sludge (AS) bacterial
      community and identify core microbes in different wastewater processing systems, 
      seasonal AS samples were taken from every biological treatment unit within 4
      full-scale wastewater treatment plants. These plants adopted A2/O, A/O and
      oxidation ditch processes and were active in the treatment of different types and
      sources of wastewater, some domestic and others industrial. The bacterial
      community composition was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing technology.
      The correlations among microbial community structure, dominant microbes and
      process performance were investigated. Seasonal variation had a stronger impact
      on the AS bacterial community than any variation within different wastewater
      treatment system. Facing seasonal variation, the bacterial community within the
      oxidation ditch process remained more stable those in either the A2/O or A/O
      processes. The core genera in domestic wastewater treatment systems were
      Nitrospira, Caldilineaceae, Pseudomonas and Lactococcus. The core genera in the
      textile dyeing and fine chemical industrial wastewater treatment systems were
      Nitrospira, Thauera and Thiobacillus.

AB  - Obesity and other lifestyle diseases in modern society can be related to
      historical dietary changes from diets balanced in omega-6 and omega-3 to the
      unbalanced "Western-type" diet. It is recognized that diet influences the murine 
      and human gut microbiome, and most research indicates that microbial diversity
      and composition are altered by high-fat diets (HFDs). However, good knowledge
      about the effects of early exposure to HFD on the maturation and structure of the
      bacterial community is limited. Using mice as model, we hypothesized that an HFD 
      alters the early dynamic of the gut bacterial community toward an
      unstable/unhealthy state. By sequencing the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S
      ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene, we investigated the bacterial community in fecal
      samples of mice fed a control diet and an HFD at weaning (sampling time 1) and
      after 8 weeks of dietary intervention (11weeks of age; sampling time 2). Natural 
      temporal microbiome maturation was evidenced by a general increase in microbial
      diversity and shifts in microbial community between sampling times 1 and 2 toward
      a mature community. However, the HFD led to significant structural segregation of
      the microbiome compared with controls; the HFD diet repressed health-enhancing
      bacteria (eg, Bifidobacterium and Akkermansia) and promoted health-detracting
      bacteria (ie, those associated with gut disorders, eg, Dorea). We suggest that
      early-life consumption of HFD negatively impacts the natural gut bacterial
      community maturation leading toward a potentially persistent unhealthy stage.

TI  - Holobionts and ecological speciation: the intestinal microbiota of lake whitefish
      species pairs.
PG  - 47
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0427-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is well established that symbionts have considerable impact on
      their host, yet the investigation of the possible role of the holobiont in the
      host's speciation process is still in its infancy. In this study, we compared the
      intestinal microbiota among five sympatric pairs of dwarf (limnetic) and normal
      (benthic) lake whitefish Coregonus clupeaformis representing a continuum in the
      early stage of ecological speciation. We sequenced the 16s rRNA gene V3-V4
      regions of the intestinal microbiota present in a total of 108 wild sympatric
      dwarf and normal whitefish as well as the water bacterial community from five
      lakes to (i) test for differences between the whitefish intestinal microbiota and
      the water bacterial community and (ii) test for parallelism in the intestinal
      microbiota of dwarf and normal whitefish. RESULTS: The water bacterial community 
      was distinct from the intestinal microbiota, indicating that intestinal
      microbiota did not reflect the environment, but rather the intrinsic properties
      of the host microbiota. Our results revealed a strong influence of the host
      (dwarf or normal) on the intestinal microbiota with pronounced conservation of
      the core intestinal microbiota (mean ~ 44% of shared genera). However, no clear
      evidence for parallelism was observed, whereby non-parallel differences between
      dwarf and normal whitefish were observed in three of the lakes while similar
      taxonomic composition was observed for the two other species pairs. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This absence of parallelism across dwarf vs. normal whitefish microbiota
      highlighted the complexity of the holobiont and suggests that the direction of
      selection could be different between the host and its microbiota.

AB  - The intestinal tract, which harbours tremendous numbers of bacteria, plays a
      pivotal role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients. Here, high-throughput 
      sequencing technology was used to determine the community composition and
      complexity of the intestinal microbiota in cultivated European eels during three 
      stages of their lifecycle, after which the metabolic potentials of their
      intestinal microbial communities were assessed. The results demonstrated that
      European eel intestinal microbiota were dominated by bacteria in the phyla
      Proteobacteria and Fusobacteria. Statistical analyses revealed that the three
      cultured European eel life stages (elver, yellow eel, and silver eel) shared core
      microbiota dominated by Aeromonas. Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by
      Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) predictions of metagenome function 
      revealed that the European eel intestinal microbiota might play significant roles
      in host nutrient metabolism. Biolog AN MicroPlate analysis and extracellular
      enzyme assays of culturable intestinal bacteria showed that the intestinal
      microbiota have a marked advantage in the metabolism of starch, which is the main
      carbohydrate component in European eel formulated feed. Understanding the ecology
      and functions of the intestinal microbiota during different developmental stages 
      will help us improve the effects of fish-based bacteria on the composition and
      metabolic capacity of nutrients in European eels.

      Helicobacter pylori in Japan.
PG  - 287
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2018.00287 [doi]
AB  - Helicobacter pylori is a causative pathogen of chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer
      disease, and gastric cancer. Humans are known to be a natural host for H. pylori 
      and tend to acquire the pathogen before the age of 5 years. The infection may
      then persist lifelong if eradication therapy is not applied. One of the modes of 
      transmission of H. pylori is between family members, and therefore, the presence 
      of infected family members is an important risk factor in children. However,
      other environmental factors have not been fully analyzed. The present study was
      performed to clarify whether and to what extent intestinal microbiota affect H.
      pylori intrafamilial infection. The fecal specimens from H. pylori-infected
      infants and H. pylori-infected and non-infected family members were collected in 
      cohort studies conducted by Sasayama City, Hyogo Prefecture from 2010 to 2013. In
      total, 18 fecal DNA from 5 families were analyzed. Samples were amplified using
      16S rRNA universal primers, and the amplicons were sequenced using the Ion PGM
      system. Principal-coordinate analysis demonstrated that there was no difference
      in intestinal microbiota between H. pylori-positive and H. pylori-negative
      groups. In intrafamilial comparison tests, the Manhattan distance of intestinal
      microbiota between the H. pylori-infected infant proband and H. pylori-negative
      mother was nearest in the family with low intestinal microbial diversity.
      However, in the family with the highest intestinal microbial diversity, the
      nearest Manhattan distance was shown between the H. pylori-infected infant
      proband and H. pylori-infected mother. The results in this study showed that the 
      composition of the intestinal microbiota was very similar between members of the 
      same family, and as such, colonization with organisms highly similar to the
      infected parent(s) may be a risk factor for H. pylori infection in children.

      Reveals Signature Microbes.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00118 [doi]
AB  - Heterogeneity amidst healthy individuals at genomic level is being widely
      acknowledged. This, in turn, is modulated by differential response to
      environmental cues and treatment regimens, necessitating the need for
      stratified/personalized therapy. We intend to understand the molecular
      determinants of Ayurvedic way (ancient Indian system of medicine) of
      endo-phenotyping individuals into distinct constitution types termed "Prakriti," 
      which forms the basis of personalized treatment. In this study, we explored and
      analyzed the healthy human gut microbiome structure within three predominant
      Prakriti groups from a genetically homogenous cohort to discover differentially
      abundant taxa, using 16S rRNA gene based microbial community profiling. We found 
      Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes as major gut microbial components in varying
      composition, albeit with similar trend across Prakriti. Multiple species of the
      core microbiome showed differential abundance within Prakriti types, with gender 
      specific signature taxons. Our study reveals that despite overall uniform
      composition of gut microbial community, healthy individuals belonging to
      different Prakriti groups have enrichment of specific bacteria. It highlights the
      importance of Prakriti based endo-phenotypes to explain the variability amongst
      healthy individuals in gut microbial flora that have important consequences for
      an individual's health, disease and treatment.

TI  - Assessment of vaginal microbiota in Brazilian women with and without bacterial
      vaginosis and comparison with Nugent score.
PG  - 127-136
LID - 10.3855/jidc.9532 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by the depletion of
      Lactobacillus spp. population and increase of other species, especially
      Gardnerella vaginalis and Atopobium vaginae. This study aimed to investigate the 
      vaginal microbiota structure of Brazilian women with and without BV according to 
      Nugent Score and to assess the correlation among Nugent score and the
      quantification of BV-associated bacteria. METHODOLOGY: Polymerase Chain
      Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) assay was employed to
      characterize the vaginal microbiota structure. Quantification of Lactobacillus
      spp., G. vaginalis, A. vaginae, Mobiluncus sp. and M. hominis were determined by 
      quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). RESULTS: Clustering by PCR-DGGE revealed
      differences in microbial structure of the different patient groups. Gardnerella
      vaginalis, A. vaginae, M. hominis and Mobiluncus sp. were detected at high loads 
      in BV-associated microbiota. Quantification of Lactobacillus spp. showed an
      inverse correlation with Nugent score while the loads of G. vaginalis, A.
      vaginae, M. hominis and Mobiluncus sp. indicated a direct correlation with this
      method. CONCLUSIONS: Despite Nugent score is considered the gold standard for BV 
      diagnosis, qPCR stands out as a useful tool for bacteria quantification and an
      alternative for BV diagnosis. Vaginal microbiota is a complex microbial community
      although there is a common core among BV and non-BV women. Investigation of
      vaginal microbiota structure may contribute to the development of tools for
      diagnosis improvement and therapeutic regimen optimization.

TI  - Effects of repeated subacute ruminal acidosis challenges on the adaptation of the
      rumen bacterial community in Holstein bulls.
PG  - 4424-4436

AB  - We investigated the effect of repeated subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA)
      challenges on the pH, fermentative function, and bacterial community in the
      rumen. Four rumen-cannulated Holstein bulls were fed a high-forage diet for 7 d
      (HF period) followed by a high-grain diet for 7 d (HG period). Four SARA
      challenges were carried out consecutively (first, second, third, and fourth
      challenges). The ruminal pH was measured continuously during the experiment, and 
      rumen fluid samples during the first to fourth challenges were collected at 0800,
      1400, and 2000 h on the last days of each feeding period for analysis; volatile
      fatty acid components, NH3-N, and lactic acid concentrations were measured.
      Bacterial community structure was analyzed at 0800 h during the first and fourth 
      challenges on the last days of each period. The 24-h mean ruminal pH was
      decreased during the transition from high-forage to high-grain diet and tended to
      differ between the HF and HG periods. During the HG period, ruminal pH <5.6 was
      maintained for a longer period in the first and second challenges (350 and 405
      min/d, respectively) than in the third and fourth challenges (both 120 min/d). A 
      marked increase in total volatile fatty acid and NH3-N concentrations during the 
      HG period was observed in the later challenges. In addition, lower and higher
      proportions of acetic and butyric acids, respectively, were observed during the
      HG period than during the HF period. A total of 37 core bacterial genera were
      found in all samples; however, the relative abundance of several genera differed 
      significantly between the HF and HG periods (Prevotella, Ruminococcus,
      Eubacterium, and Oscillibacter) and between the first and fourth challenges
      (Eubacterium and unclassified Clostridiaceae). During the HG period, lower
      relative abundances of Prevotella, Eubacterium, and Oscillibacter and higher
      relative abundance of Ruminococcus were detected compared with during the HF
      period. The relative abundances of Eubacterium and unclassified Clostridiaceae
      were lower in the first challenge than in the fourth challenge. Bacterial
      diversity was greater during the HF period than during the HG period and was
      greater during the fourth challenge than during the first challenge.
      Interestingly, diversity indices during the HG period of the fourth challenge
      were higher than those during the HF period of the first challenge. These results
      suggested that rumen fermentation in Holstein cattle can adapt to repeated SARA
      challenges by minimizing the adverse changes in ruminal pH. Moreover, the
      composition and diversity of the ruminal bacterial community may be affected by
      ruminal pH and vice versa.

TI  - Geographic and Host-Associated Variations in Bacterial Communities on the Floret 
      Surfaces of Field-Grown Broccoli.
LID - e02837-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02837-17 [doi]
AB  - Fresh vegetables harbor diverse bacterial populations on their surfaces. However,
      information on this microbiota is limited to a few types of fresh vegetables, and
      little is known about how it varies with geography and host condition. Here, we
      analyzed bacterial communities on the floret surfaces of 66 field-grown broccoli 
      collected from 22 farms in four farming regions of Jeju Island, South Korea,
      using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, and we determined their
      relationships to farming region and host-associated factors. Geographic
      variations in bacterial community composition and diversity were observed among
      farming regions, which partly reflected their relative humidity and insolation.
      The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria,
      Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes; core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned
      to Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, and
      Enterobacteriaceae contributed to the community differences. Bacterial community 
      composition differed between immature and mature samples, with mature samples
      harboring higher bacterial diversity. In comparison with communities on other
      types of fresh vegetables and fruits, bacterial communities on broccoli florets
      were unique but more similar to those of ground vegetables than to those of tree 
      fruits/vegetables. This study presents novel data on the variability of
      floret-associated bacterial populations of field-grown broccoli relative to
      environmental and host-associated factors.IMPORTANCE Fresh vegetables harbor
      diverse and complex bacterial populations on their surfaces. These indigenous
      bacteria may play a role in human and crop health; however, the diversity and
      variability of bacterial communities on fresh vegetables require further study. A
      popular crop of leafy vegetables, broccoli, is of great agricultural and
      industrial importance. This study provides a detailed description of the
      bacterial community composition and diversity on the surfaces of broccoli
      florets. The variability of bacterial communities is associated with the
      geographic location of farming sites and is affected by host growth and health.
      The bacterial communities specific to broccoli were identified and showed greater
      similarity to those found on ground vegetables than to those found on tree
      fruits/vegetables. This study presents novel data on the impact of environmental 
      and host-associated conditions on the variability of floret-associated bacterial 
      populations present on field-grown broccoli.

AB  - The widespread adoption of engineered wetlands designed for water treatment is
      hindered by uncertainties in system reliability, resilience and management
      associated with coupled biological and physical processes. To better understand
      how shallow unit process open-water wetlands self-colonize and evolve, we
      analyzed the composition of the microbial community in benthic biomats from
      system establishment through approximately 3 years of operation. Our analysis was
      conducted across three parallel demonstration-scale (7500m(2)) cells located
      within the Prado Constructed Wetlands in Southern California. They received water
      from the Santa Ana River (5.9+/-0.2mg/L NO3-N), a water body where the flow is
      dominated by municipal wastewater effluent from May to November. Phylogenetic
      inquiry and microscopy confirmed that diatoms and an associated aerobic bacterial
      community facilitated early colonization. After approximately nine months of
      operation, coinciding with late summer, an anaerobic community emerged with the
      capability for nitrate attenuation. Varying the hydraulic residence time (HRT)
      from 1 to 4 days the subsequent year resulted in modest ecological changes across
      the three parallel cells that were most evident in the outlet regions of the
      cells. The community that established at this time was comparatively stable for
      the remaining years of operation and converged with one that had previously
      formed approximately 550km (350 miles) away in a pilot-scale (400m(2)) wetland in
      Northern California. That system received denitrified (20.7+/-0.7mg/L NO3-N),
      secondary treated municipal wastewater for 5 years of operation. Establishment of
      a core microbiome between the two systems revealed a strong overlap of both
      aerobic and anaerobic taxa with approximately 50% of the analyzed bacterial
      sequences shared between the two sites. Additionally the same species of diatom, 
      Stauirsa construens var. venter, was prolific in both systems as the putative
      dominant primary producer. Our results indicate that despite differences in
      scale, geographic location and source waters, the shallow open-water wetland
      design can select for a rapid convergence of microbial structure and
      functionality associated with the self-colonizing benthic biomat. This resulting 
      biomat matures over the first growing season with operational parameters such as 
      HRT further exerting a modest selective bias on community succession.

TI  - Abiotic Stresses Shift Belowground Populus-Associated Bacteria Toward a Core
      Stress Microbiome.

AB  - Adverse growth conditions can lead to decreased plant growth, productivity, and
      survival, resulting in poor yields or failure of crops and biofeedstocks. In some
      cases, the microbial community associated with plants has been shown to alleviate
      plant stress and increase plant growth under suboptimal growing conditions. A
      systematic understanding of how the microbial community changes under these
      conditions is required to understand the contribution of the microbiome to water 
      utilization, nutrient uptake, and ultimately yield. Using a microbiome
      inoculation strategy, we studied how the belowground microbiome of Populus
      deltoides changes in response to diverse environmental conditions, including
      water limitation, light limitation (shading), and metal toxicity. While plant
      responses to treatments in terms of growth, photosynthesis, gene expression and
      metabolite profiles were varied, we identified a core set of bacterial genera
      that change in abundance in response to host stress. The results of this study
      indicate substantial structure in the plant microbiome community and identify
      potential drivers of the phytobiome response to stress. IMPORTANCE The
      identification of a common "stress microbiome" indicates tightly controlled
      relationships between the plant host and bacterial associates and a conserved
      structure in bacterial communities associated with poplar trees under different
      growth conditions. The ability of the microbiome to buffer the plant from extreme
      environmental conditions coupled with the conserved stress microbiome observed in
      this study suggests an opportunity for future efforts aimed at predictably
      modulating the microbiome to optimize plant growth.

TI  - Dietary changes during weaning shape the gut microbiota of red pandas (Ailurus
      fulgens).
PG  - cox075
LID - 10.1093/conphys/cox075 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian herbivores have developed numerous adaptations to utilize their
      plant-based diets including a modified gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and symbiosis
      with a GIT microbiota that plays a major role in digestion and the maintenance of
      host health. The red panda (Ailurus fulgens) is a herbivorous carnivore that
      lacks the specialized GIT common to other herbivores but still relies on
      microorganisms for survival on its almost entirely bamboo diet. The GIT
      microbiota is of further importance in young red pandas, as high cub mortality is
      problematic and has been attributed to failure to meet nutritional requirements. 
      To gain insight into the establishment of the GIT microbiota of red pandas, we
      examined microbial communities in two individuals following dietary changes
      associated with weaning using next-generation 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq paired-end 
      sequencing of faecal samples. Across all four stages (pre-weaning, during
      weaning, post-weaning and adult), the GIT microbial community displayed low
      diversity and was dominated by bacteria in the phylum Firmicutes with lesser
      contributions from the Proteobacteria. A core community was found consistently
      across all weaning stages and included species within the taxa
      Escherichia-Shigella, Streptococcus, Clostridium and an unclassified
      Clostridiaceae. Analysis of the overall community composition and structure
      showed that although the GIT microbiota is established early in red pandas,
      dietary changes during weaning further shape the community and are correlated
      with the presence of new bacterial species. This work is the first analysis of
      the GIT microbiota for red panda cubs during weaning and provides a framework for
      understanding how diet and host microbiota impact the development of these
      threatened animals.

TI  - Longitudinal Effects of Supplemental Forage on the Honey Bee (Apis mellifera)
      Microbiota and Inter- and Intra-Colony Variability.
PG  - 814-824
LID - 10.1007/s00248-018-1151-y [doi]
AB  - Honey bees (Apis mellifera) provide vital pollination services for a variety of
      agricultural crops around the world and are known to host a consistent core
      bacterial microbiome. This symbiotic microbial community is essential to many
      facets of bee health, including likely nutrient acquisition, disease prevention
      and optimal physiological function. Being that the bee microbiome is likely
      involved in the digestion of nutrients, we either provided or excluded honey bee 
      colonies from supplemental floral forage before being used for almond
      pollination. We then used 16S rRNA gene sequencing to examine the effects of
      forage treatment on the bees' microbial gut communities over four months. In
      agreement with previous studies, we found that the honey bee gut microbiota is
      quite stable over time. Similarly, we compared the gut communities of bees from
      separate colonies and sisters sampled from within the same hive over four months.
      Surprisingly, we found that the gut microbial communities of individual sisters
      from the same colony can exhibit as much variation as bees from different
      colonies. Supplemental floral forage had a subtle effect on the composition of
      the microbiome during the month of March only, with strains of Gilliamella
      apicola, Lactobacillus, and Bartonella being less proportionally abundant in bees
      exposed to forage in the winter. Collectively, our findings show that there is
      unexpected longitudinal variation within the gut microbial communities of sister 
      honey bees and that supplemental floral forage can subtly alter the microbiome of
      managed honey bees.

TI  - A human gut phage catalog correlates the gut phageome with type 2 diabetes.
PG  - 24
LID - 10.1186/s40168-018-0410-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Substantial efforts have been made to link the gut bacterial
      community to many complex human diseases. Nevertheless, the gut phages are often 
      neglected. RESULTS: In this study, we used multiple bioinformatic methods to
      catalog gut phages from whole-community metagenomic sequencing data of fecal
      samples collected from both type II diabetes (T2D) patients (n = 71) and normal
      Chinese adults (n = 74). The definition of phage operational taxonomic units
      (pOTUs) and identification of large phage scaffolds (n = 2567, >/= 10 k) revealed
      a comprehensive human gut phageome with a substantial number of novel sequences
      encoding genes that were unrelated to those in known phages. Interestingly, we
      observed a significant increase in the number of gut phages in the T2D group and,
      in particular, identified 7 pOTUs specific to T2D. This finding was further
      validated in an independent dataset of 116 T2D and 109 control samples.
      Co-occurrence/exclusion analysis of the bacterial genera and pOTUs identified a
      complex core interaction between bacteria and phages in the human gut ecosystem, 
      suggesting that the significant alterations of the gut phageome cannot be
      explained simply by co-variation with the altered bacterial hosts. CONCLUSIONS:
      Alterations in the gut bacterial community have been linked to the chronic
      disease T2D, but the role of gut phages therein is not well understood. This is
      the first study to identify a T2D-specific gut phageome, indicating the existence
      of other mechanisms that might govern the gut phageome in T2D patients. These
      findings suggest the importance of the phageome in T2D risk, which warrants
      further investigation.

TI  - Microbiome Structure Influences Infection by the Parasite Crithidia bombi in
      Bumble Bees.
LID - e02335-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02335-17 [doi]
AB  - Recent declines in bumble bee populations are of great concern and have prompted 
      critical evaluations of the role of pathogen introductions and host resistance in
      bee health. One factor that may influence host resilience when facing infection
      is the gut microbiota. Previous experiments with Bombus terrestris, a European
      bumble bee, showed that the gut microbiota can protect against Crithidia bombi, a
      widespread trypanosomatid parasite of bumble bees. However, the particular
      characteristics of the microbiome responsible for this protective effect have
      thus far eluded identification. Using wild and commercially sourced Bombus
      impatiens, an important North American pollinator, we conducted cross-wise
      microbiota transplants to naive hosts of both backgrounds and challenged them
      with a Crithidia parasite. As with B. terrestris, we find that
      microbiota-dependent protection against Crithidia operates in B. impatiens Lower 
      Crithidia infection loads were experimentally associated with high microbiome
      diversity, large gut bacterial populations, and the presence of Apibacter,
      Lactobacillus Firm-5, and Gilliamella spp. in the gut community. These results
      indicate that even subtle differences between gut community structures can have a
      significant impact on a microbiome's ability to defend against parasite
      infections.IMPORTANCE Many wild bumble bee populations are under threat due to
      human activity, including through the introduction of pathogens via commercially 
      raised bees. Recently, it was found that the bumble bee gut microbiota can help
      defend against a common parasite, Crithidia bombi, but the particular factors
      contributing to this protection are unknown. Using both wild and commercially
      raised bees, we conducted microbiota transplants to show that microbiome
      diversity, total gut bacterial load, and the presence of certain core members of 
      the microbiota may all impact bee susceptibility to Crithidia infection. Bee
      origin (genetic background) was also a factor. Finally, by examining this
      phenomenon in a previously uninvestigated bee species, our study demonstrates
      that microbiome-mediated resistance to Crithidia is conserved across multiple
      bumble bee species. These findings highlight how intricate interactions between
      hosts, microbiomes, and parasites can have wide-ranging consequences for the
      health of ecologically important species.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Both genetic and environmental factors are conceivably required to
      assess the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), yet little is known 
      regarding the relationship between oral microbiome and the mutational spectrum of
      OSCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to study 
      the composition of oral microorganisms in OSCC patients, whose cancer mutational 
      profiles were previously defined by whole-exome sequencing, to evaluate the
      relationship between oral microbiome and the mutational changes in OSCC. RESULTS:
      Analyzing the contributions of the five mutational signatures extracted from the 
      primary tumors revealed three groups of OSCC (mutational signature cluster,
      MSC1-3) that were significantly associated with demographic and clinical
      features. Taxonomic analysis of the predominant phyla in salivary samples showed 
      variation in the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the three 
      MSC groups. In addition, significant differences in bacterial species richness
      (alpha diversity) and slight sample-to-sample dissimilarities in bacterial
      community structures (beta diversity) were noted among different MSC groups.
      Further, predicting the functional capabilities of microbial communities by
      reconstruction of unobserved states showed that many pathways related to cell
      motility were differentially enriched among the three MSC groups. CONCLUSION:
      Collectively, these results indicate a potential association of oral microbiome
      with the mutational changes in OSCC.

TI  - Characterization of the Skin Microbiota of the Cane Toad Rhinella cf. marina in
      Puerto Rico and Costa Rica.
PG  - 2624
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2017.02624 [doi]
AB  - Rhinella marina is a toad native to South America that has been introduced in the
      Antilles, likely carrying high loads of microorganisms, potentially impacting
      local community diversity. The amphibian skin is involved in pathogen defense and
      its microbiota has been relatively well studied, however, research focusing on
      the cane toad microbiota is lacking. We hypothesize that the skin microbial
      communities will differ between toads inhabiting different geographical regions
      in Central America and the Caribbean. To test our hypothesis, we compared the
      microbiota of three populations of R. cf. marina toads, two from Costa Rican
      (native) and one Puerto Rican (exotic) locations. In Costa Rica, we collected 11 
      toads, 7 in Sarapiqui and 4 from Turrialba while in Puerto Rico, 10 animals were 
      collected in Santa Ana. Separate swab samples were collected from the dorsal and 
      ventral sites resulting in 42 samples. We found significant differences in the
      structure of the microbial communities between Puerto Rico and Costa Rica. We
      detected as much as 35 different phyla; however, communities were dominated by
      Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. Alpha diversity
      and richness were significantly higher in toads from Puerto Rico and
      betadiversity revealed significant differences between the microbiota samples
      from the two countries. At the genus level, we found in Santa Ana, Puerto Rico, a
      high dominance of Kokuria, Niabella, and Rhodobacteraceae, while in Costa Rica we
      found Halomonas and Pseudomonas in Sarapiqui, and Acinetobacter and Citrobacter
      in Turrialba. This is the first report of Niabella associated with the amphibian 
      skin. The core microbiome represented 128 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs)
      mainly from five genera shared among all samples, which may represent the
      symbiotic Rhinella's skin. These results provide insights into the
      habitat-induced microbial changes facing this amphibian species. The differences 
      in the microbial diversity in Puerto Rican toads compared to those in Costa Rica 
      provide additional evidence of the geographically induced patterns in the
      amphibian skin microbiome, and highlight the importance of discussing the
      microbial tradeoffs in the colonization of new ecosystems.

TI  - Influence of Pig Farming on the Human Nasal Microbiota: Key Role of Airborne
      Microbial Communities
LID - e02470-17 [pii]
LID - 10.1128/AEM.02470-17 [doi]
AB  - It has been hypothesized that the environment can influence the composition of
      the nasal microbiota. However, the direct influence of pig farming on the
      anterior and posterior nasal microbiota is unknown. Using a cross-sectional
      design, pig farms (n = 28) were visited in 2014 to 2015, and nasal swabs from 43 
      pig farmers and 56 pigs, as well as 27 air samples taken in the vicinity of the
      pig enclosures, were collected. As controls, nasal swabs from 17 cow farmers and 
      26 non-animal-exposed individuals were also included. Analyses of the microbiota 
      were performed based on 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and the DADA2 pipeline to
      define sequence variants (SVs). We found that pig farming is strongly associated 
      with specific microbial signatures (including alpha- and beta-diversity), which
      are reflected in the microbiota of the human nose. Furthermore, the microbial
      communities were more similar within the same farm compared to between the
      different farms, indicating a specific microbiota pattern for each pig farm. In
      total, there were 82 SVs that occurred significantly more abundantly in samples
      from pig farms than from cow farmers and nonexposed individuals (i.e., the core
      pig farm microbiota). Of these, nine SVs were significantly associated with the
      posterior part of the human nose. The results strongly indicate that pig farming 
      is associated with a distinct human nose microbiota. Finally, the community
      structures derived by the DADA2 pipeline showed an excellent agreement with the
      outputs of the mothur pipeline which was revealed by procrustes analyses.
      IMPORTANCE The knowledge about the influence of animal keeping on the human
      microbiome is important. Previous research has shown that pets significantly
      affect the microbial communities of humans. However, the effect of animal farming
      on the human microbiota is less clear, although it is known that the air at farms
      and, in particular, at pig farms is charged with large amounts of dust, bacteria,
      and fungi. In this study, we simultaneously investigated the nasal microbiota of 
      pigs, humans, and the environment at pig farms. We reveal an enormous impact of
      pig farming on the human nasal microbiota which is far more pronounced compared
      to cow farming. In addition, we analyzed the airborne microbiota and found
      significant associations suggesting an animal-human transmission of the
      microbiota within pig farms. We also reveal that microbial patterns are farm
      specific, suggesting that the environment influences animals and humans in a
      similar manner.

      variety of important functions in its animal hosts, including host health.
      However, the complex interactions between gut microbes and environment are still 
      unclear. Honey bees are ecologically and economically important pollinators that 
      host a core gut microbial community that is thought to be constant across
      populations. Here, we examined whether the composition of the gut microbial
      community of honey bees is affected by the environmental landscape the bees are
      exposed to. We placed honey bee colonies reared under identical conditions in two
      main landscape types for 6 weeks: either oilseed rape farmland or agricultural
      farmland distant to fields of flowering oilseed rape. The gut bacterial
      communities of adult bees from the colonies were then characterized and compared 
      based on amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. While previous studies have
      delineated a characteristic core set of bacteria inhabiting the honey bee gut,
      our results suggest that the broad environment that bees are exposed to has some 
      influence on the relative abundance of some members of that microbial community. 
      This includes known dominant taxa thought to have functions in nutrition and
      health. Our results provide evidence for an influence of landscape exposure on
      honey bee microbial community and highlight the potential effect of exposure to
      different environmental parameters, such as forage type and neonicotinoid
      pesticides, on key honey bee gut bacteria. This work emphasizes the complexity of
      the relationship between the host, its gut bacteria, and the environment and
      identifies target microbial taxa for functional analyses.

TI  - Profiling of subgingival plaque biofilm microbiota in female adult patients with 
      clear aligners: a three-month prospective study.
PG  - e4207
LID - 10.7717/peerj.4207 [doi]
AB  - Background: Clear aligners are well known for facilitating oral hygiene
      maintenance and decreasing susceptibility to periodontal diseases as compared to 
      conventional fixed appliances. However, few research studies focus on the
      subgingival microbial community during clear aligner treatment (CAT). Hence, this
      study investigates changes of the subgingival microbial community and its
      association with clinical characteristics during the first three months of CAT.
      Methods: Ten female patients with clear aligners were enrolled in this study.
      Subgingival plaque samples were obtained at three time points: before orthodontic
      treatment (T0), one month after orthodontic treatment (T1) and three months after
      orthodontic treatment (T2). DNA was then extracted from plaque samples and
      analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Periodontal examinations, including plaque 
      index (PI) and gingival bleeding index (GBI) measurements were also recorded.
      Results: The plaque indices (PIs) and gingival bleeding indices (GBIs) were
      slightly increased at T1 and T2, but no statistically significant difference was 
      found. The alpha diversity indices, including the ACE, Chao1, Shannon indices,
      all showed a declining trend without significance, and a rising trend in the
      Simpson diversity index was observed. The weighted UniFrac distance was
      significantly higher at T1 and T2 compared with T0. Principal Coordinates
      Analysis (PCoA) demonstrated that the communities at T0 tended to cluster apart
      from the communities at T1 and T2. The relative abundance of the phylum
      Firmicutes and genus Mycoplasma was significantly increased at T0 compared with
      T2. There was no significant difference in the relative abundance of periodontal 
      pathogens at the genus and species levels or core microorganisms at the genus
      level. Conclusion: A slightly decreasing microbial diversity with a significant
      change of microbial structure was found during the first three-month clear
      aligner treatment (CAT). However, subjects receiving clear aligner treatment were
      free from periodontal diseases with relatively stable levels of periodontal
      microorganisms and core microorganisms. Thus, our preliminary findings indicated 
      that clear aligners induced nonpathogenic changes of the subgingival microbiome
      in the first three-month treatment.

AB  - To gain insight into the bacterial dynamics present in drinking water treatment
      (DWT) systems, the microbial community and activity in a full-scale DWT plant
      (DWTP) in Guangzhou, South China, were investigated using Illumina Hiseq
      sequencing analyses combined with cultivation-based techniques during the wet and
      dry seasons. Illumina sequencing analysis of 16S rRNA genes revealed a large
      shift in the proportion of Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes during
      the treatment process, with the proportion of Actinobacteria decreased sharply,
      whereas that of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes increased and predominated in
      treated water. Both microbial activity and bacterial diversity during the
      treatment process showed obvious spatial variation, with higher levels observed
      during the dry season and lower levels during the wet season. Clustering analysis
      and principal component analysis indicated dramatic shifts in the bacterial
      community after chlorination, suggesting that chlorination was highly effective
      at influencing the bacterial community. The bacterial community structure of
      finished water primarily comprised Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, and Acinetobacter,
      and interestingly showed high similarity to biofilms on granular activated
      carbon. Additionally, the abundance of bacterial communities was relatively
      stable in finished water and did not change with the season. A large number of
      unique operational taxonomic units were shared during treatment steps, indicating
      the presence of a diverse core microbiome throughout the treatment process.
      Opportunistic pathogens, including Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Citrobacter,
      Mycobacterium, Salmonella, Staphylococcus, Legionella, Streptococcus and
      Enterococcus, were detected in water including finished water, suggesting a
      potential threat to drinking-water safety. We also detected bacteria isolated
      from each treatment step using the pure-culture method. In particular, two
      isolates, identified as Mycobacterium sp. and Blastococcus sp., which belong to
      the phylum Actinobacteria, were obtained from finished water during the dry
      season. Together, these results provided evidence of spatial and temporal
      variations in DWTPs and contributed to the beneficial manipulation of the
      drinking water microbiome.

TI  - Individual- and Species-Specific Skin Microbiomes in Three Different Estrildid
      Finch Species Revealed by 16S Amplicon Sequencing.
PG  - 518-529

AB  - An animals' body is densely populated with bacteria. Although a large number of
      investigations on physiological microbial colonisation have emerged in recent
      years, our understanding of the composition, ecology and function of the
      microbiota remains incomplete. Here, we investigated whether songbirds have an
      individual-specific skin microbiome that is similar across different body
      regions. We collected skin microbe samples from three different bird species
      (Taeniopygia gutatta, Lonchura striata domestica and Stagonopleura gutatta) at
      two body locations (neck region, preen gland area). To characterise the skin
      microbes and compare the bacterial composition, we used high-throughput 16S rRNA 
      amplicon sequencing. This method proved suitable for identifying the skin
      microbiome of birds, even though the bacterial load on the skin appeared to be
      relatively low. We found that across all species, the two evaluated skin areas of
      each individual harboured very similar microbial communities, indicative of an
      individual-specific skin microbiome. Despite experiencing the same environmental 
      conditions and consuming the same diet, significant differences in the skin
      microbe composition were identified among the three species. The bird species
      differed both quantitatively and qualitatively regarding the observed bacterial
      taxa. Although each species harboured its own unique set of skin microbes, we
      identified a core skin microbiome among the studied species. As microbes are
      known to influence the host's body odour, our findings of an individual-specific 
      skin microbiome might suggest that the skin microbiome in birds is involved in
      the odour production and could encode information on the host's genotype.

TI  - Food Storage by the Savanna Termite Cornitermes cumulans (Syntermitinae): a
      Strategy to Improve Hemicellulose Digestibility?
PG  - 492-505
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1128-2 [doi]
AB  - It has been suggested that food storage inside the nest may offer termites with a
      nutritional provision during low resource availability. Additionally, feces
      employed as construction material provide an excellent environment for
      colonization by microorganisms and, together with the storage of plant material
      inside the nest, could thus provide some advantage to the termites in terms of
      lignocellulose decomposition. Here, we conducted for the first time a
      comprehensive study of the microbial communities associated to a termite
      exhibiting food storage behavior using Illumina sequencing of the 16S and (ITS2) 
      regions of rRNA genes, together with enzymatic assays and data collected in the
      field. Cornitermes cumulans (Syntermitinae) stored grass litter in nodules made
      from feces and saliva located in the nest core. The amount of nodules increased
      with nest size and isolation, and interestingly, the soluble fraction of extracts
      from nodules showed a higher activity against hemicellulosic substrates compared 
      to termite guts. Actinobacteria and Sordariales dominated microbial communities
      of food nodules and nest walls, whereas Spirochetes and Pleosporales dominated
      gut samples of C. cumulans. Within Syntermitinae, however, gut bacterial
      assemblages were dissimilar. On the other hand, there is a remarkable convergence
      of the bacterial community structure of Termitidae nests. Our results suggest
      that the role of nodules could be related to food storage; however, the higher
      xylanolytic activity in the nodules and their associated microbiota could also
      provide C. cumulans with an external source of predigested polysaccharides, which
      might be advantageous in comparison with litter-feeding termites that do not
      display food storage behavior.

AB  - The skin is the first line of defense between an animal and its environment, and 
      disruptions in skin-associated microorganisms can be linked to an animal's health
      and nutritional state. To better understand the skin microbiome of large whales, 
      high-throughput sequencing of partial small subunit rRNA genes was used to study 
      the skin-associated bacteria of 89 seemingly healthy humpback whales (Megaptera
      novaeangliae) sampled along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) during early
      (2010) and late (2013) austral summers. Six core groups of bacteria were present 
      in 93% or more of all humpback skin samples. A shift was observed in the average 
      relative abundances of these core bacteria over time, with the emergence of four 
      additional core groups of bacteria that corresponded to a decrease in water
      temperature, possibly caused by season- or foraging-related changes in skin
      biochemistry that influenced microbial growth, or other temporal factors. The
      skin microbiome differed between whales sampled at several regional locations
      along the WAP, suggesting that environmental factors or population may also
      influence the whale skin microbiome. Overall, the skin microbiome of humpback
      whales appears to provide insight into animal- and environment-related factors
      and may serve as a useful indicator for animal health or ecosystem
      alterations.IMPORTANCE The microbiomes of wild animals are currently understudied
      but may provide information about animal health and/or animal-environment
      interactions. In the largest sampling of any marine mammal microbiome, this study
      demonstrates conservation in the skin microbiome of 89 seemingly healthy humpback
      whales sampled in the Western Antarctic Peninsula, with shifts in the bacterial
      community composition related to temporal and regional variability. This study is
      important because it suggests that the skin microbiome of humpback whales could
      provide insight into animal nutritional or seasonal/environment-related factors, 
      which are becoming increasingly important to recognize due to unprecedented rates
      of climate change and anthropogenic impact on ocean ecosystems.

AB  - Currently, membrane biofouling in membrane bioreactors (MBRs) is normally
      attributed to the occurrence of abundant bacterial species on membranes, whereas 
      the roles of low-abundance bacteria have not been paid sufficient attention. In
      this study, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm 
      was used to identify active biomarkers, determining 67 different phylotypes among
      Bulk sludge, low-fouling Bio-cake (10 kPa), high-fouling Bio-cake (25 kPa) and
      Membrane pore in a membrane bioreactor with NaOCl backwash. Interestingly, a
      large proportion of the active biomarkers in bio-cake samples, such as
      Methylophilaceae, Burkholderiaceae, Paucibacter and Pseudoxanthomonas, did not
      fall within the abundant taxa (i.e., <0.05% relative abundance), indicating the
      preferential growth of these low-abundance bacteria on the membrane surface.
      Furthermore, the characterization of microbial interactions using a random matrix
      theory (RMT)-based network approach obtained a network consisting of 120 nodes
      and 228 edges. Specifically, network analysis showed the presence of an intense
      competition among bacterial species in the fouling-related communities,
      suggesting that negative interactions have an important effect on determining the
      microbial community structure. More importantly, the LEfSe algorithm and network 
      analysis showed that most of the core species of the bio-cake, such as
      Burkholderiaceae, Bacillus and Rhodothermaceae, merely amounted to a very low
      relative abundance (<1%), suggesting their unrecognized and over-proportional
      ecological role in triggering the initial biofilm formation and subsequent
      biofilm maturation during MBR operation. Overall, this work should improve our
      understanding of the bacterial community structure on the fouled membranes in
      MBRs.

TI  - Distribution and Diversity of Ocular Microbial Communities in Diabetic Patients
      Compared with Healthy Subjects.
PG  - 314-324
LID - 10.1080/02713683.2017.1406528 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify differences in the major (core vs.
      variable) microbial genera of human subjects with and without diabetes. METHODS: 
      Bacterial 16S rRNA genes obtained from conjunctival swabs of 19 healthy subjects 
      and 30 diabetic patients were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and
      the sequencing data were analyzed using QIIME 1.9.1. To elucidate the microbial
      diversity in the ocular surface (OS), test programs from various bioinformatics
      domains were used. RESULTS: Diversity index and rarefaction analysis showed that 
      the microbial community of the diabetic patients was more diverse than that of
      the healthy subjects. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria
      and Bacteroidetes were the dominant taxa present in the OS, and there was a
      significant difference in the relative abundance of the bacterial phyla between
      the diabetic patients and control subjects. Proteobacteria were more abundant in 
      the diabetic group, whereas Firmicutes was more abundant in the control group.
      Analysis of bacterial taxa at the genus level showed that the core microbiome of 
      diabetic patients comprised Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and
      Ralstonia, whereas that of the controls comprised Bradyrhizobiaceae,
      Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, Neisseriaceae, and
      Acinetobacter. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the microbial
      community composition between diabetic patients and healthy subjects. A high
      abundance of Acinetobacter in the OS of diabetic patients may arise from the
      unique characteristics of the OS compared with those of other organ surfaces.

TI  - Antibiotics reduce genetic diversity of core species in the honeybee gut
      microbiome.
PG  - 2057-2066
LID - 10.1111/mec.14434 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiome plays a key role in animal health, and perturbing it can have 
      detrimental effects. One major source of perturbation to microbiomes, in humans
      and human-associated animals, is exposure to antibiotics. Most studies of how
      antibiotics affect the microbiome have used amplicon sequencing of highly
      conserved 16S rRNA sequences, as in a recent study showing that antibiotic
      treatment severely alters the species-level composition of the honeybee gut
      microbiome. But because the standard 16S rRNA-based methods cannot resolve
      closely related strains, strain-level changes could not be evaluated. To address 
      this gap, we used amplicon sequencing of protein-coding genes to assess effects
      of antibiotics on fine-scale genetic diversity of the honeybee gut microbiota. We
      followed the population dynamics of alleles within two dominant core species of
      the bee gut community, Gilliamella apicola and Snodgrassella alvi, following
      antibiotic perturbation. Whereas we observed a large reduction in genetic
      diversity in G. apicola, S. alvi diversity was mostly unaffected. The reduction
      in G. apicola diversity accompanied an increase in the frequency of several
      alleles, suggesting resistance to antibiotic treatment. We find that antibiotic
      perturbation can cause major shifts in diversity and that the extent of these
      shifts can vary substantially across species. Thus, antibiotics impact not only
      species composition, but also allelic diversity within species, potentially
      affecting hosts if variants with particular functions are reduced or eliminated. 
      Overall, we show that amplicon sequencing of protein-coding genes, without
      clustering into operational taxonomic units, provides an accurate picture of the 
      fine-scale dynamics of microbial communities over time.

AB  - Bovine milk contains a complex microbial community that affects the quality and
      safety of the product. Detailed knowledge of this microbiota is, therefore, of
      importance for the dairy industry. In this study, the bacterial composition of
      consumption milk was assessed during different stages in the production line and 
      throughout the storage in cartons by using culturing techniques and 16S rRNA
      marker gene sequencing. Monthly samples from two dairies were analyzed to capture
      the seasonal variations in the milk microbiota. Although there was a core
      microbiota present in milk samples from both dairies, the composition of the
      bacterial communities were significantly influenced by sampling month, processing
      stage and storage temperature. Overall, a higher abundance of operational
      taxonomic units (OTUs) within the order Bacillales was detected in samples of raw
      and pasteurized milk from the spring and summer months, while Pseudomonadales and
      Lactobacillales OTUs were predominant in the winter months. OTUs belonging to the
      order Lactobacillales, Pseudomonadales, Clostridiales and Bacillales were
      significantly more abundant in milk samples taken immediately after
      pasteurization compared to raw milk samples. During storage of milk in cartons at
      4 degrees C, the bacterial composition remained stable throughout the product
      shelf life, while storage at 8 degrees C significantly increased the abundance of
      OTUs belonging to the genus Bacillus and the plate count levels of presumptive
      Bacillus cereus. The knowledge obtained in this work will be useful to the dairy 
      industry during their quality assurance work and risk assessment practices.

LID - 10.1111/gwat.12615 [doi]
AB  - Spatial distribution (horizonal and vertical) of groundwater microbial
      communities and the hydrogeochemistry in confined aquifers were studied
      approximately along the groundwater flow path from coteau to plain in the Nomhon 
      area, Qinghai-Tibet plateau, China. The confined groundwater samples at different
      depths and locations were collected in three boreholes through a hydrogeological 
      section in this arid and semi-arid area. The phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA
      genes and multivariate statistical analysis were used to elucidate similarities
      and differences between groundwater microbial communities and hydrogeochemical
      properties. The integrated isotopic geochemical measurements were applied to
      estimate the source and recharge characteristics of groundwater. The results
      showed that groundwater varied from fresh to saline water, and modern water to
      ancient water following the flowpath. The recharge characteristics of the saline 
      water was distinct with that of fresh water. Cell abundance did not vary greatly 
      along the hydrogeochemical zonality; however, dissimilarities in habitat-based
      microbial community structures were evident, changing from Betaproteobacteria in 
      the apex of alluvial fan to Gammaproteobacteria and then to Epsilonproteobacteria
      in the core of the basin (alluvial-lacustrine plain). Rhodoferax, Hydrogenophaga,
      Pseudomonas, and bacterium isolated from similar habitats unevenly thrived in the
      spatially distinct fresh water environments, while Sulfurimonas dominanted in the
      saline water environment. The microbial communities presented likely reflected to
      the hydrogeochemical similarities and zonalities along groundwater flowpath.

AB  - Diversity and composition of lepidopteran microbiotas are poorly investigated,
      especially across the different developmental stages. To improve this knowledge, 
      we characterize the microbiota among different developmental stages of the Indian
      meal moth, Plodia interpunctella, which is considered one of the major pest of
      commodities worldwide. Using culture-independent approach based on Illumina 16S
      rRNA gene sequencing we characterized the microbiota of four developmental
      stages: eggs, first-, and last-instar larvae, and adult. A total of 1022
      bacterial OTUs were obtained, showing a quite diversified microbiota associated
      to all the analyzed stages. The microbiotas associated with P. interpunctella
      resulted almost constant throughout the developmental stages, with approximately 
      77% of bacterial OTUs belonging to the phylum of Proteobacteria. The dominant
      bacterial genus is represented by Burkholderia ( approximately 64%), followed by 
      Propionibacterium, Delftia, Pseudomonas, and Stenotrophomonas. A core bacterial
      community, composed of 139 OTUs, was detected in all the developmental stages,
      among which 112 OTUs were assigned to the genus Burkholderia. A phylogenetic
      reconstruction, based on the 16S rRNA, revealed that our Burkholderia OTUs
      clustered with Burkholderia cepacia complex, in the same group of those isolated 
      from the hemipterans Gossyparia spuria and Acanthococcus aceris. The functional
      profiling, predicted on the base of the bacterial 16S rRNA, indicates differences
      in the metabolic pathways related to metabolism of amino acids between
      preimaginal and adult stages. We can hypothesize that bacteria may support the
      insect host during preimaginal stages.

AB  - Pharmaceuticals are micropollutants often present in wastewater treatment
      systems. In this study, the potential impact of such micropollutants on the
      bacterial population within aerobic granular sludge (AGS) bioreactor was
      investigated. The AGS bacterial community structure and composition were accessed
      combining DGGE fingerprinting and barcoded pyrosequencing analysis. Both revealed
      the existence of a dynamic bacterial community, independently of the
      pharmaceuticals presence. The AGS microbiome at both phylum and class levels
      varied over time and, after stopping pharmaceuticals feeding, the bacterial
      community did not return to its initial composition. Nevertheless, most of the
      assigned OTUs were present throughout the different operational phases. This core
      microbiome, represented by over 72% of the total sequences in each phase,
      probably played an important role in biological removal processes, avoiding their
      failure during the disturbance period. Quantitative-PCR revealed that
      pharmaceuticals load led to gradual changes on the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing
      bacteria (AOB), nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and polyphosphate-accumulating
      organisms (PAO) but their persistence during that phase demonstrated the
      resilience of such bacterial groups. AGS microbiome changed over time but a core 
      community was maintained, probably ensuring the accomplishment of the main
      biological removal processes.

AB  - Understanding the role of microbiota as reproductive barriers or sources of
      adaptive novelty in the fundamental biological phenomenon of speciation is an
      exciting new challenge necessitating exploration of microbiota variation in wild 
      interbreeding species. We focused on two interbreeding cyprinid species,
      Chondrostoma nasus and Parachondrostoma toxostoma, which have geographic
      distributions characterized by a mosaic of hybrid zones. We described microbiota 
      diversity and composition in the three main teleost mucosal tissues, the skin,
      gills and gut, in the parental parapatric populations. We found that tissue type 
      was the principal determinant of bacterial community composition. In particular, 
      there was strong microbiota differentiation between external and internal
      tissues, with secondary discrimination between the two species. These findings
      suggest that specific environmental and genetic filters associated with each
      species have shaped the bacterial communities, potentially reflecting
      deterministic assemblages of bacteria. We defined the core microbiota common to
      both Chondrostoma species for each tissue, highlighting the occurrence of
      microbe-host genome interactions at this critical level for studies of the
      functional consequences of hybridization. Further investigations will explore to 
      what extend these specific tissue-associated microbiota signatures could be
      profoundly altered in hybrids, with functional consequences for post-mating
      reproductive isolation in relation to environmental constraints.

PG  - 529-542
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1068-x [doi]
AB  - The lower respiratory tract has been previously considered sterile in a healthy
      state, but advances in culture-independent techniques for microbial
      identification and characterization have revealed that the lung harbors a diverse
      microbiome. Although research on the lung microbiome is increasing and important 
      questions were already addressed, longitudinal studies aiming to describe
      developmental stages of the microbial communities from the early neonatal period 
      to adulthood are lacking. Thus, little is known about the early-life development 
      of the lung microbiome and the impact of external factors during these stages. In
      this study, we applied a barcoding approach based on high-throughput sequencing
      of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon libraries to determine age-dependent
      differences in the bacterial fraction of the murine lung microbiome and to assess
      potential influences of differing "environmental microbiomes" (simulated by the
      application of used litter material to the cages). We could clearly show that the
      diversity of the bacterial community harbored in the murine lung increases with
      age. Interestingly, bacteria belonging to the genera Delftia and Rhodococcus
      formed an age-independent core microbiome. The addition of the used litter
      material influenced the lung microbiota of young mice but did not significantly
      alter the community composition of adult animals. Our findings elucidate the
      dynamic nature of the early-life lung microbiota and its stabilization with age. 
      Further, this study indicates that even slight environmental changes modulate the
      bacterial community composition of the lung microbiome in early life, whereas the
      lung microbes of adults demonstrate higher resilience towards environmental
      variations.

      Trauma-Related Disorders.

LID - 10.1089/omi.2017.0077 [doi]
AB  - Biological psychiatry research has long focused on the brain in elucidating the
      neurobiological mechanisms of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. This review 
      challenges this assumption and suggests that the gut microbiome and its
      interactome also deserve attention to understand brain disorders and develop
      innovative treatments and diagnostics in the 21st century. The recent, in-depth
      characterization of the human microbiome spurred a paradigm shift in human health
      and disease. Animal models strongly suggest a role for the gut microbiome in
      anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis sits
      at the epicenter of this new approach to mental health. The microbiome plays an
      important role in the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)
      axis early in life, and stress reactivity over the life span. In this review, we 
      highlight emerging findings of microbiome research in psychiatric disorders,
      focusing on anxiety- and trauma-related disorders specifically, and discuss the
      gut microbiome as a potential therapeutic target. 16S rRNA sequencing has enabled
      researchers to investigate and compare microbial composition between individuals.
      The functional microbiome can be studied using methods involving metagenomics,
      metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics, as discussed in the
      present review. Other factors that shape the gut microbiome should be considered 
      to obtain a holistic view of the factors at play in the complex interactome
      linked to the MGB. In all, we underscore the importance of microbiome science,
      and gut microbiota in particular, as emerging critical players in mental illness 
      and maintenance of mental health. This new frontier of biological psychiatry and 
      postgenomic medicine should be embraced by the mental health community as it
      plays an ever-increasing transformative role in integrative and holistic health
      research in the next decade.

TI  - Seasonal Stability in the Microbiomes of Temperate Gorgonians and the Red Coral
      Corallium rubrum Across the Mediterranean Sea.
PG  - 274-288
LID - 10.1007/s00248-017-1006-y [doi]
AB  - Populations of key benthic habitat-forming octocoral species have declined
      significantly in the Mediterranean Sea due to mass mortality events caused by
      microbial disease outbreaks linked to high summer seawater temperatures.
      Recently, we showed that the microbial communities of these octocorals are
      relatively structured; however, our knowledge on the seasonal dynamics of these
      microbiomes is still limited. To investigate their seasonal stability, we
      collected four soft gorgonian species (Eunicella singularis, Eunicella cavolini, 
      Eunicella verrucosa and Leptogorgia sarmentosa) and the precious red coral
      (Corallium rubrum) from two coastal locations with different terrestrial impact
      levels in the Mediterranean Sea, and used next-generation amplicon sequencing of 
      the 16S rRNA gene. The microbiomes of all soft gorgonian species were dominated
      by the same 'core microbiome' bacteria belonging to the Endozoicomonas and the
      Cellvibrionales clade BD1-7, whereas the red coral microbiome was primarily
      composed of 'core' Spirochaetes, Oceanospirillales ME2 and Parcubacteria. The
      associations with these bacterial taxa were relatively consistent over time at
      each location for each octocoral species. However, differences in microbiome
      composition and seasonal dynamics were observed between locations and could
      primarily be attributed to locally variant bacteria. Overall, our data provide
      further evidence of the intricate symbiotic relationships that exist between
      Mediterranean octocorals and their associated microbes, which are ancient and
      highly conserved over both space and time, and suggest regulation of the
      microbiome composition by the host, depending on local conditions.

TI  - Gut microbial communities of American pikas (Ochotona princeps): Evidence for
      phylosymbiosis and adaptations to novel diets.
PG  - 323-330
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.12692 [doi]
AB  - Gut microbial communities provide many physiological functions to their hosts,
      especially in herbivorous animals. We still lack an understanding of how these
      microbial communities are structured across hosts in nature, especially within a 
      given host species. Studies on laboratory mice have demonstrated that host
      genetics can influence microbial community structure, but that diet can overwhelm
      these genetic effects. We aimed to test these ideas in a natural system, the
      American pika (Ochotona princeps). First, pikas are high-elevation specialists
      with significant population structure across various mountain ranges in the USA, 
      allowing us to investigate whether similarities in microbial communities match
      host genetic differences. Additionally, pikas are herbivorous, with some
      populations exhibiting remarkable dietary plasticity and consuming high levels of
      moss, which is exceptionally high in fibre and low in protein. This allows us to 
      investigate adaptations to an herbivorous diet, as well as to the especially
      challenging diet of moss. Here, we inventoried the microbial communities of pika 
      caecal pellets from various populations using 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate 
      structuring of microbial communities across various populations with different
      natural diets. Microbial communities varied significantly across populations, and
      differences in microbial community structure were congruent with genetic
      differences in host population structure, a pattern known as "phylosymbiosis."
      Several microbial members (Ruminococcus, Prevotella, Oxalobacter and Coprococcus)
      were detected across all samples, and thus likely represent a "core microbiome." 
      These genera are known to perform a number of services for herbivorous hosts such
      as fibre fermentation and the degradation of plant defensive compounds, and thus 
      are likely important for herbivory in pikas. Moreover, pikas that feed on moss
      harboured microbial communities highly enriched in Melainabacteria. This
      uncultivable candidate phylum has been proposed to ferment fibre for herbivores, 
      and thus may contribute to the ability of some pika populations to consume high
      amounts of moss. These findings demonstrate that both host genetics and diet can 
      influence the microbial communities of the American pika. These animals may be
      novel sources of fibre-degrading microbes. Last, we discuss the implications of
      population-specific microbial communities for conservation efforts in this
      species.
