abstract={Microbiome-wide association studies on large population cohorts have highlighted associations between the gut microbiome and complex traits, including type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity1. However, the causal relationships remain largely unresolved. We leveraged information from 952 normoglycemic individuals for whom genome-wide genotyping, gut metagenomic sequence and fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels were available2, then combined this information with genome-wide-association summary statistics for 17 metabolic and anthropometric traits. Using bidirectional Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to assess causality3, we found that the host-genetic-driven increase in gut production of the SCFA butyrate was associated with improved insulin response after an oral glucose-tolerance test (P = 9.8 × 10-5), whereas abnormalities in the production or absorption of another SCFA, propionate, were causally related to an increased risk of T2D (P = 0.004). These data provide evidence of a causal effect of the gut microbiome on metabolic traits and support the use of MR as a means to elucidate causal relationships from microbiome-wide association findings.},

abstract={Microgenderome or sexual dimorphism in microbiome refers to the bidirectional interactions between microbiotas, sex hormones, and immune systems, and it is highly relevant to disease susceptibility. A critical step in exploring microgenderome is to dissect the sex differences in key community ecology properties, which has not been systematically analyzed. This study aims at filling the gap by reanalyzing the Human Microbiome Project datasets with two objectives: (i) dissecting the sex differences in community diversity and their intersubject scaling, species composition, core/periphery species, and high-salience skeletons (species interactions); (ii) offering mechanistic interpretations for (i). Conceptually, the Vellend-Hanson synthesis of community ecology that stipulates selection, drift, speciation, and dispersal as the four processes driving community dynamics is followed. Methodologically, seven approaches reflecting the state-of-the-art research in medical ecology of human microbiomes are harnessed to achieve the objectives. It is postulated that the revealed microgenderome characteristics (categorized as seven aspects of differences/similarities) exert far reaching influences on disease susceptibility, and are primarily due to the sex difference in selection effects (deterministic fitness differences in microbial species and/or species interactions with each other or with their hosts), which are, in turn, shaped/modulated by host physiology (immunity, hormones, gut-brain communications, etc.).},

abstract={Core microbiome members are consistent features of a dataset that are hypothesized to reflect underlying functional relationships with the host. A review of the recent plant-microbiome literature reveals a variety of study-specific approaches used to define the core, which presents a challenge to building a general plant-microbiome framework. Abundance-occupancy distributions, used in macroecology to describe changes in community diversity over space, offer an ecological approach for prioritizing core membership for both spatial and temporal studies. Additionally, neutral models fit to the abundance-occupancy distributions can provide insights into deterministically selected core members. We provide examples and code to systematically explore a core plant microbiome from abundance-occupancy distributions. Though we focus on examples from and discussions relevant to the plant microbiome, the abundance-occupancy method can be widely and generally applied to prioritize core membership for any microbiome.},

abstract={Pseudomonas aeruginosa DN1 strain and Bacillus subtilis QHQ110 strain were chosen as rhamnolipid and lipopeptide producer respectively, to evaluate the efficiency of exogenous inoculants on enhancing oil recovery (EOR) and to explore the relationship between injected bacteria and indigenous bacterial community dynamics in long-term filed pilot of Hujianshan low permeability water-flooded reservoir for 26 months. Core-flooding tests showed that the oil displacement efficiency increased by 18.46% with addition of exogenous consortia. Bacterial community dynamics using quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing revealed that the exogenous inoculants survived and could live together with indigenous bacterial populations. They gradually became the dominant community after the initial activation, while their comparative advantage weakened continually after 3 months of the first injection. The bacterial populations did not exert an observable change in the process of the second injection of exogenous inoculants. On account of facilitating oil emulsification and accelerating bacterial growth with oil as the carbon source by the injection of exogenous consortia, gamma-proteobacteria was finally the prominent bacterial community at class level varying from 25.55 to 32.67%, and the dominant bacterial populations were increased by 2-3 orders of magnitude during the whole processes. The content of organic acids and rhamnolipids in reservoir were promoted with the change of bacterial community diversity, respectively. Cumulative oil increments reached 26,190 barrels for 13 months after the first injection, and 55,947 barrels of oil had been accumulated in all of A20 wells block through two rounds of bacterial consortia injection. The performance of EOR has a cumulative improvement by the injection of exogenous inoculants without observable inhibitory effect on the indigenous bacterial populations, demonstrating the application potential in low permeability water-flooded reservoirs.},

abstract={PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to identify differences in the major (core vs. variable) microbial genera of human subjects with and without diabetes. METHODS: Bacterial 16S rRNA genes obtained from conjunctival swabs of 19 healthy subjects and 30 diabetic patients were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform, and the sequencing data were analyzed using QIIME 1.9.1. To elucidate the microbial diversity in the ocular surface (OS), test programs from various bioinformatics domains were used. RESULTS: Diversity index and rarefaction analysis showed that the microbial community of the diabetic patients was more diverse than that of the healthy subjects. Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant taxa present in the OS, and there was a significant difference in the relative abundance of the bacterial phyla between the diabetic patients and control subjects. Proteobacteria were more abundant in the diabetic group, whereas Firmicutes was more abundant in the control group. Analysis of bacterial taxa at the genus level showed that the core microbiome of diabetic patients comprised Acinetobacter, Burkholderia, Sphingomonas, and Ralstonia, whereas that of the controls comprised Bradyrhizobiaceae, Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Pseudomonas, Novosphingobium, Neisseriaceae, and Acinetobacter. CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in the microbial community composition between diabetic patients and healthy subjects. A high abundance of Acinetobacter in the OS of diabetic patients may arise from the unique characteristics of the OS compared with those of other organ surfaces.},
