abstract={Unraveling the key drivers of bacterial community assembly in agricultural soils is pivotal for soil nutrient management and crop productivity. Presently, the drivers of microbial community structure remain unexplored in maize cropping systems under complex and variable environmental scenarios across large spatial scales. In this study, we conducted high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and network analysis to identify the major environmental factors driving bacterial community diversity and co-occurrence patterns in 21 maize field soils across China. The results show that mean annual precipitation and soil pH are the major environmental factors that shape soil bacterial communities in maize soils. The similarities of bacterial communities significantly decreased with increasing geographic distance between different sites. The differences in spatial turnover rates across bacterial phyla indicate the distinct dispersal capabilities of bacterial groups, and some abundant phyla exhibited high dispersal capabilities. Aeromicrobium, Friedmanniella, Saccharothrix, Lamia, Rhodococcus, Skermanella, and Pedobacter were identified as keystone taxa. Based on the node-level and network-level topological features, members of the core microbiome were more frequently found in the center of the ecosystem network compared with other taxa. This study highlights the major environmental factors driving bacterial community assembly in agro-ecosystems and the central ecological role of the core microbiome in maintaining the web of complex bacterial interactions.},

abstract={Seeds play key roles in the acquisition of plant pioneer microbiota, including the transmission of microbes from parent plants to offspring. However, the issues about seed microbial communities are mostly unknown, especially for their potential origins and the factors influencing the structure and composition. In this study, samples of rice seed and rhizosphere were collected from northeast and central-south China in two harvest years and analyzed using a metabarcoding approach targeting 16S rRNA gene region. A higher level of vertical transmission (from parent seed microbiota to offspring) was revealed, as compared to the acquisition from the rhizosphere (25.5 vs 10.7%). The core microbiota of the rice seeds consisted of a smaller proportion of OTUs (3.59%) than that of the rice rhizosphere (7.54%). Among the core microbiota, species in Arthrobacter, Bacillus, Blastococcus, Curtobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Ramlibacter have been reported as potential pathogens and/or beneficial bacteria for plants. Both the seed and the rhizosphere of rice showed distance-decay of similarity in microbial communities. Seed moisture and winter mean annual temperature (WMAT) had significant impacts on seed microbiota, while WMAT, total carbon, available potassium, available phosphorus, aluminum, pH, and total nitrogen significantly determined the rhizosphere microbiota. Multiple functional pathways were found to be enriched in the seed or the rhizosphere microbiota, which, to some extent, explained the potential adaptation of bacterial communities to respective living habitats. The results presented here elucidate the composition and possible sources of rice seed microbiota, which is crucial for the health and productivity management in sustainable agriculture.},

abstract={Microorganisms that colonize the plant rhizosphere can contribute to plant health, growth and productivity. Although the importance of the rhizosphere microbiome is known, we know little about the underlying mechanisms that drive microbiome assembly and composition. In this study, the variation, assembly and composition of rhizobacterial communities in 11 tomato cultivars, combined with one cultivar in seven different sources of soil and growing substrate, were systematically investigated. The tomato rhizosphere microbiota was dominated by bacteria from the phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria, mainly comprising Rhizobiales, Xanthomonadales, Burkholderiales, Nitrosomonadales, Myxococcales, Sphingobacteriales, Cytophagales and Acidobacteria subgroups. The bacterial community in the rhizosphere microbiota of the samples in the cultivar experiment mostly overlapped with that of tomato cultivar MG, which was grown in five natural field soils, DM, JX, HQ, QS and XC. The results supported the hypothesis that tomato harbors largely conserved communities and compositions of rhizosphere microbiota that remains consistent in different cultivars of tomato and even in tomato cultivar grown in five natural field soils. However, significant differences in OTU richness (p < 0.0001) and bacterial diversity (p = 0.0014 < 0.01) were observed among the 7 different sources of soil and growing substrate. Two artificial commercial nutrient soils, HF and CF, resulted in a distinct tomato rhizosphere microbiota in terms of assembly and core community compared with that observed in natural field soils. PERMANOVA of beta diversity based on the combined data from the cultivar and soil experiments demonstrated that soil (growing substrate) and plant genotype (cultivar) had significant impacts on the rhizosphere microbial communities of tomato plants (soil, F = 22.29, R(2) = 0.7399, p < 0.001; cultivar, F = 2.04, R(2) = 0.3223, p = 0.008). Of these two factors, soil explained a larger proportion of the compositional variance in the tomato rhizosphere microbiota. The results demonstrated that the assembly process of rhizosphere bacterial communities was collectively influenced by soil, including the available bacterial sources and biochemical properties of the rhizosphere soils, and plant genotype.},

abstract={The immune system responds vigorously to microbial infection while permitting lifelong colonization by the microbiome. Mechanisms that facilitate the establishment and stability of the gut microbiota remain poorly described. We found that a regulatory system in the prominent human commensal Bacteroides fragilis modulates its surface architecture to invite binding of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in mice. Specific immune recognition facilitated bacterial adherence to cultured intestinal epithelial cells and intimate association with the gut mucosal surface in vivo. The IgA response was required for B. fragilis (and other commensal species) to occupy a defined mucosal niche that mediates stable colonization of the gut through exclusion of exogenous competitors. Therefore, in addition to its role in pathogen clearance, we propose that IgA responses can be co-opted by the microbiome to engender robust host-microbial symbiosis.},

abstract={Massive blood loss, a common pathological complication in the clinic, is often accompanied by altered gut integrity and intestinal wall damage. Little is known to what extent the gut microbiome could be correlated with this process. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in human health, especially in immune and inflammatory responses. This study aims to determine whether acute blood loss affects the gut microbiome and the dynamic variation of the gut microbiome following the loss of blood. We used New Zealand rabbits to mimic the blood loss complication and designed a five-time-point fecal sampling strategy including 24-h pre-blood loss procedure, 24 h, 36 h, 48 h, and 1-week post-blood loss procedure. Gut microbiome composition and diversity were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and downstream alpha-diversity, beta-diversity, and taxonomy analysis. The gut microbiome changed dramatically after blood loss procedure. There was a significant increase in diversity and richness of the gut microbiome at 24-h post-procedure (P = 0.038). Based on an analysis of similarities, the composition of gut microbiome in the samples collected at 24-h post-procedure was significantly different from that of pre-procedure samples (r = 0.79, P = 0.004 weighted unifrac distance; r = 0.99, P = 0.002, unweighted unifrac distance). The relative abundance of Lactobacillus was significantly decreased in the post-procedure samples (P = 0.0006), while the relative abundance of Clostridiales (P = 0.018) and Bacteroidales (P = 0.015) was significantly increased after procedure. We also found the relative abundance of Bacilli, Lactobacillus, Myroides, and Prevotella decreased gradually at different time points after blood loss. The relative abundance of the Clostridia, Alphaproteobacteria, and Sporosarcina increased at 24-h post-procedure and decreased thereafter. This preliminary study discovered potential connections between blood loss and dysbiosis of gut microbiome. The diversity and abundance of the gut microbiome was affected to various extents after acute blood loss and unable to be restored to the original microbiome profile even after one week. The increase in relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens after blood loss could be an important indication to reconsider immune and inflammatory responses after acute blood loss from the perspective of gut microbiome.},
