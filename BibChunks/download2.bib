abstract={Adaptation to specialized diets often requires modifications at both genomic and microbiome levels. We applied a hologenomic approach to the common vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), one of the only three obligate blood-feeding (sanguivorous) mammals, to study the evolution of its complex dietary adaptation. Specifically, we assembled its high-quality reference genome (scaffold N50 = 26.9 Mb, contig N50 = 36.6 kb) and gut metagenome, and compared them against those of insectivorous, frugivorous and carnivorous bats. Our analyses showed a particular common vampire bat genomic landscape regarding integrated viral elements, a dietary and phylogenetic influence on gut microbiome taxonomic and functional profiles, and that both genetic elements harbour key traits related to the nutritional (for example, vitamin and lipid shortage) and non-nutritional (for example, nitrogen waste and osmotic homeostasis) challenges of sanguivory. These findings highlight the value of a holistic study of both the host and its microbiota when attempting to decipher adaptations underlying radical dietary lifestyles.},

abstract={Gut microbial community structure was evaluated for two species of bivalve molluscs, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and the blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) collected from Long Island Sound, Connecticut, over the course of a year. These bivalves utilize a shared feeding mechanism, which may result in similar gut microbial communities. Their particle diet, marine aggregates, and surrounding environment, aggregate-free seawater (AFSW), were also collected for comparison. Due to the suspension-feeding activities of bivalves, the potential for aggregate- and AFSW-associated microbiota to influence their microbial communities may be significant. Both taxonomic and functional diversity of the samples were assessed. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing indicated that oysters and mussels maintained similar, but not identical, gut microbiomes, with some temporal variation. Throughout the year, bivalve species had gut microbial community compositions that were more similar to one another than to aggregates. Within a month, bivalves shared on average a quarter of their total operational taxonomic units (OTUs) with each other and a 10th of their total OTUs with aggregates. During months with warm water temperatures, individuals within each of the four sample types had similar alpha diversity, but again, temporal variation was observed. On a functional level, bivalve gut microbial communities exhibited variation attributed to host species and season. Unlike oysters, mussel gut bacterial communities maintained high richness and evenness values throughout the year, even when values for the particle diet and AFSW were reduced. Overall, a core gut bivalve microbiome was present, and it was partially influenced by the marine aggregate microbial community.IMPORTANCE This work investigates the influence that extrinsic factors, diet, and the environment can have on the microbiomes of shellfish. Over the course of a year, the gut microbial communities of two species of bivalves, oysters and mussels, held under identical conditions in coastal marine waters were compared. While the mussels and oysters harbored gut microbial communities with similar composition, on a functional level, they exhibited species and temporal variation. These results indicate that intrinsic factors influence the bivalve microbiome, resulting in species variability, even when environmental conditions, feeding mechanism, and particle diet are constant. Seasonal and multispecies comparisons for bivalve-associated microbial communities are rare, and we believe this research represents an important contribution. The results presented here advance our understanding of the symbiotic interactions between marine invertebrates, the microbial communities they harbor, and the environment.},

abstract={Fresh vegetables harbor diverse bacterial populations on their surfaces. However, information on this microbiota is limited to a few types of fresh vegetables, and little is known about how it varies with geography and host condition. Here, we analyzed bacterial communities on the floret surfaces of 66 field-grown broccoli collected from 22 farms in four farming regions of Jeju Island, South Korea, using 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA amplicons, and we determined their relationships to farming region and host-associated factors. Geographic variations in bacterial community composition and diversity were observed among farming regions, which partly reflected their relative humidity and insolation. The most abundant phyla were Proteobacteria, followed by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes; core operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assigned to Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Oxalobacteraceae, Comamonadaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae contributed to the community differences. Bacterial community composition differed between immature and mature samples, with mature samples harboring higher bacterial diversity. In comparison with communities on other types of fresh vegetables and fruits, bacterial communities on broccoli florets were unique but more similar to those of ground vegetables than to those of tree fruits/vegetables. This study presents novel data on the variability of floret-associated bacterial populations of field-grown broccoli relative to environmental and host-associated factors.IMPORTANCE Fresh vegetables harbor diverse and complex bacterial populations on their surfaces. These indigenous bacteria may play a role in human and crop health; however, the diversity and variability of bacterial communities on fresh vegetables require further study. A popular crop of leafy vegetables, broccoli, is of great agricultural and industrial importance. This study provides a detailed description of the bacterial community composition and diversity on the surfaces of broccoli florets. The variability of bacterial communities is associated with the geographic location of farming sites and is affected by host growth and health. The bacterial communities specific to broccoli were identified and showed greater similarity to those found on ground vegetables than to those found on tree fruits/vegetables. This study presents novel data on the impact of environmental and host-associated conditions on the variability of floret-associated bacterial populations present on field-grown broccoli.},

abstract={Intestinal microbiota perform important functions for the health of fishes. Knowing the microbial composition and evaluating the possible effects caused by anthropogenic pollution in the intestinal microbiota of fish populations might represent an important step in defining microbial biomarkers for water pollution. This study evaluated the impact of environmental contamination on the gut microbiota of the livebearer killifish Phalloceros caudimaculatus. The 16S survey using the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was used to characterize and compare the microbiota of two P. caudimaculatus populations from streams with different levels of environmental contamination in Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. Twelve bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) (around one-third of the total) were shared between both fish populations. They represent the core microbiota of the gut in this species. The dominant phyla were Protebacteria and Firmicutes, with more than 80% of relative abundance. The dominant genus was Burkholderia with more than 35% of the relative abundance irrespective of the environmental condition. We detected a lower microbial diversity (Shannon index and observed OTUs) in fish from the polluted stream compared to the reference stream. The PERMANOVA analysis showed that the intestinal microbial communities from fish living in the polluted stream were distinct from those found in the reference stream (p < 0.05). Finally, we identified Luteolibacter, Methylocaldum and Rhodobacter genera, which correlated strongly with the polluted stream. These taxa might represent potential microbial biomarkers of exposure to environmental contaminants in the guts of fish. Confirmation of these findings in other polluted environments might allow the development of a microbiota-based screening approach for environmental evaluation in ecotoxicological studies in aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract={Background: Identifying core microbiota is an important step for understanding the key components of microbial communities. Traditional approach that identifies core taxa at the OTU level ignores potential ecological coherence of higher rank taxa. There is a need to develop software that can systematically identify core taxa at and above the species level. Results: Here we developed PhyloCore, an application that uses a phylogeny-based algorithm to identify core taxa at the proper taxonomic levels. It incorporates a number of features that users can set according to their needs. Using multiple gut microbiota as test cases, we demonstrate that PhyloCore is more powerful and flexible than OTU-based approaches. Conclusions: PhyloCore is a flexible and fast application that identifies core taxa at proper taxonomic levels, making it useful to sequence-based microbial ecology studies.
