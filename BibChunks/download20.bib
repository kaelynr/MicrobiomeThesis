abstract={Adverse growth conditions can lead to decreased plant growth, productivity, and survival, resulting in poor yields or failure of crops and biofeedstocks. In some cases, the microbial community associated with plants has been shown to alleviate plant stress and increase plant growth under suboptimal growing conditions. A systematic understanding of how the microbial community changes under these conditions is required to understand the contribution of the microbiome to water utilization, nutrient uptake, and ultimately yield. Using a microbiome inoculation strategy, we studied how the belowground microbiome of Populus deltoides changes in response to diverse environmental conditions, including water limitation, light limitation (shading), and metal toxicity. While plant responses to treatments in terms of growth, photosynthesis, gene expression and metabolite profiles were varied, we identified a core set of bacterial genera that change in abundance in response to host stress. The results of this study indicate substantial structure in the plant microbiome community and identify potential drivers of the phytobiome response to stress. IMPORTANCE The identification of a common "stress microbiome" indicates tightly controlled relationships between the plant host and bacterial associates and a conserved structure in bacterial communities associated with poplar trees under different growth conditions. The ability of the microbiome to buffer the plant from extreme environmental conditions coupled with the conserved stress microbiome observed in this study suggests an opportunity for future efforts aimed at predictably modulating the microbiome to optimize plant growth.},

abstract={The idea that much of our genome is irrelevant to fitness-is not the product of positive natural selection at the organismal level-remains viable. Claims to the contrary, and specifically that the notion of "junk DNA" should be abandoned, are based on conflating meanings of the word "function". Recent estimates suggest that perhaps 90% of our DNA, though biochemically active, does not contribute to fitness in any sequence-dependent way, and possibly in no way at all. Comparisons to vertebrates with much larger and smaller genomes (the lungfish and the pufferfish) strongly align with such a conclusion, as they have done for the last half-century.},

abstract={The asaccharolytic anaerobe Porphyromonas gingivalis metabolizes proteins it encounters in the periodontal pocket, including host-derived glycoproteins such as mucins and immunoglobulins. Often, these proteins are protected by a diverse array of carbohydrates tethered to the polypeptide chain via glycolytic bonds, and P. gingivalis produces enzymes capable of liberating these carbohydrates, exposing the proteinaceous core. In this study, we investigated the effect of individual monosaccharides, including galactose, l-fucose, mannose, and glucose, on the growth and physiology of P. gingivalis Of the carbohydrates tested, only galactose noticeably altered the density of the bacterial culture, and we observed that cultures grown with galactose reached significantly higher densities during stationary phase. Importantly, electron micrographs and plating of P. gingivalis in stationary phase demonstrated that the presence of galactose did not increase cell numbers; instead, the higher densities resulted from the expansion of individual cells which contained large intracellular granules. Initial attempts to characterize these granules revealed only a subtle increase in soluble carbohydrates, suggesting they are likely not composed of stored carbohydrate. Also, an analysis of major surface polysaccharides via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) did not reveal significant differences between cells grown with or without galactose. Finally, an initial investigation of the transcriptional changes elicited by galactose in late exponential phase suggested that genes important for cell shape and for the general stress response may play roles in this phenomenon. Overall, galactose, a monosaccharide commonly present on the surfaces of host proteins, substantially alters the physiology of P. gingivalis via the production of large, currently undefined, intracellular granules.IMPORTANCE Environmental perturbations are central to the ability of pathobionts, such as Porphyromonas gingivalis, to promote the development of diseased sites. In the case of periodontal disease, increased local pH, a shift to anaerobic surroundings, and the accumulation of Gram-negative anaerobes at the expense of Gram-positive cocci are known ecological fluctuations prominently associated with progression toward disease. Importantly, in contrast, the alterations to subgingival food webs in disease sites remain poorly characterized. We hypothesized that given the dramatic shift in community structure during disease, it is possible that free carbohydrates, which would typically be readily metabolized by Gram-positive cocci after cleavage from glycoproteins, may increase in concentration locally and thereby affect the physiological state of the subgingival microbiota. In this study, we explored the impact of free monosaccharides on P. gingivalis to gain deeper insight into the effect of dysbiotic conditions on the growth and physiology of this periodontal pathogen.},

abstract={Recent studies have provided an unprecedented view of the microbial communities colonizing captive mice; yet the host and environmental factors that shape the rodent gut microbiota in their natural habitat remain largely unexplored. Here, we present results from a 2-year 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing-based survey of wild wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in two nearby woodlands. Similar to other mammals, wild mice were colonized by 10 bacterial phyla and dominated by the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Within the Firmicutes, the Lactobacillus genus was most abundant. Putative bacterial pathogens were widespread and often abundant members of the wild mouse gut microbiota. Among a suite of extrinsic (environmental) and intrinsic (host-related) factors examined, seasonal changes dominated in driving qualitative and quantitative differences in the gut microbiota. In both years examined, we observed a strong seasonal shift in gut microbial community structure, potentially due to the transition from an insect- to a seed-based diet. This involved decreased levels of Lactobacillus, and increased levels of Alistipes (Bacteroidetes phylum) and Helicobacter. We also detected more subtle but statistically significant associations between the gut microbiota and biogeography, sex, reproductive status and co-colonization with enteric nematodes. These results suggest that environmental factors have a major role in shaping temporal variations in microbial community structure within natural populations.},

abstract={Ruminants have the remarkable ability to convert human-indigestible plant biomass into human-digestible food products, due to a complex microbiome residing in the rumen compartment of their upper digestive tract. Here we report the discovery that rumen microbiome components are tightly linked to cows' ability to extract energy from their feed, termed feed efficiency. Feed efficiency was measured in 146 milking cows and analyses of the taxonomic composition, gene content, microbial activity and metabolomic composition was performed on the rumen microbiomes from the 78 most extreme animals. Lower richness of microbiome gene content and taxa was tightly linked to higher feed efficiency. Microbiome genes and species accurately predicted the animals' feed efficiency phenotype. Specific enrichment of microbes and metabolic pathways in each of these microbiome groups resulted in better energy and carbon channeling to the animal, while lowering methane emissions to the atmosphere. This ecological and mechanistic understanding of the rumen microbiome could lead to an increase in available food resources and environmentally friendly livestock agriculture.},
