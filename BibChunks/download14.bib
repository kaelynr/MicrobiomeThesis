abstract={Phylogeny is an ecologically meaningful way to classify plants and animals, as closely related taxa frequently have similar ecological characteristics, functional traits and effects on ecosystem processes. For bacteria, however, phylogeny has been argued to be an unreliable indicator of an organism's ecology owing to evolutionary processes more common to microbes such as gene loss and lateral gene transfer, as well as convergent evolution. Here we use advanced stable isotope probing with (13)C and (18)O to show that evolutionary history has ecological significance for in situ bacterial activity. Phylogenetic organization in the activity of bacteria sets the stage for characterizing the functional attributes of bacterial taxonomic groups. Connecting identity with function in this way will allow scientists to begin building a mechanistic understanding of how bacterial community composition regulates critical ecosystem functions.},

abstract={An aerobic, Gram-stain-negative, motile and rod-shaped bacterial strain, designated as Z1-4(T), was isolated from the phycosphere microbiota of marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum that produces paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that the new isolate belongs to the genus Mesorhizobium, and it was closely related to Mesorhizobium waimense LMG 28228(T) and Mesorhizobium amorphae LMG 18977(T) with both 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 97.3%. The values of average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) relatedness between strain Z1-4(T) and its relatives are both well below the thresholds used for the delineation of a new species. A genome-based phylogenetic tree constructed by up-to-date bacterial core gene set (UBCG) indicates that strain Z1-4(T) forms an independent branch within the genus Mesorhizobium. The respiratory quinone of strain Z1-4(T) was Q-10. The major fatty acids were similar to other members of the genus Mesorhizobium containing the summed feature 8, C16:0, C19:0cycloomega8c, C17:0 and summed feature 3. The polar lipids are phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine, diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, an unidentified aminophospholipid, five glycolipids and seven unknown polar lipids. The DNA G + C content was determined to be 62.1 mol % based on its genomic sequence. Combined evidences based on the genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics clearly indicates that strain Z1-4(T) represents a novel species of the genus Mesorhizobium, for which the name Mesorhizobium alexandrii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is Z1-4(T) (= KCTC 72512(T) = CCTCC AB 2019101(T)).},

abstract={Fish-associated microbial communities play important roles in host growth, health and disease in the symbiont ecosystem; however, their diversity patterns and underlying mechanisms in different body habitats remain poorly understood. Siganus fuscescens is one of the most important consumers of macroalgae and an excellent natural marine source of nutritional lipids for humans, and widely distributes in shallow coastal areas. Here we systematically studied the microbial communities of 108 wild S. fuscescens in four body habitats (i.e., skin, gill, stomach, and hindgut) and surrounding water. We found that the beta-diversity but not alpha-diversity of fish-associated microbial communities from each habitat significantly (p < 0.05) increased as body weight increased. Also, opportunistic pathogens and probiotics (e.g., Pseudomongs, Methylobacterium) appeared to be widely distributed in different body habitats, and many digestive bacteria (e.g., Clostridium) in the hindgut; the abundances of some core OTUs associated with digestive bacteria, "Anaerovorax" (OTU_6 and OTU_46724) and "Holdemania" (OTU_33295) in the hindgut increased as body weight increased. Additionally, the quantification of ecological processes indicated that heterogeneous selection was the major process (46-70%) governing the community assembly of fish microbiomes, whereas the undominated process (64%) was found to be more important for the water microbiome. The diversity pattern showed that beta-diversity (75%) of the metacommunity overweight the alpha-diversity (25%), confirming that the niche separation of microbial communities in different habitats and host selection were important to shape the fish-associated microbial community structure. This study enhances our mechanistic understanding of fish-associated microbial communities in different habitats, and has important implications for analyzing host-associated metacommunities.},

abstract={Microbiome plays an important role during the tobacco aging process which was an indispensable link in the production and processing of cigarettes. However, the structure and functions of microbiome have not been clarified during the tobacco aging process. In this study, 16S rDNA and ITS amplicon sequencing techniques were used to analyze the core microbiome of 15 tobacco samples from five different aging stages. The whole bacterial microbiome was classified into 29 microbial phyla and 132 orders. Enterobacteriales (63%), Pseudomonadales (16%), Sphingomonadales (8%), Xanthomonadales (4%), Burkholderiales (4%), Rhizobiales (3%), and Bacillales (2%) comprised the core bacterial microbiome. The whole fungal microbiome was classified into five microbial phyla and 52 orders. Incertae_sedis_Eurotiomycetes (27%), Wallemiales (25%), Sporidiobolales (17%), Capnodiales (5%), Eurotiales (2%), an unclassified Ascomycota (12%), and an unidentified Eurotiomycetes (4%) comprised the core fungal microbiome. FAPROTAX function prediction suggested that the core microbiome has a substantial potential for the carbon cycle, nitrate metabolism, aromatic compound degradation, chitinolysis, cellulolysis, and xylanolysis, but simultaneously, the core microbiome is also a source of human pathogens. The dynamics of the bacterial community were primarily determined by the total nitrogen in tobacco leaves during the aging process, while those of the fungal microbiome were primarily determined by total organic carbon. This study indicated that the core microbiome activities may play an important role in regulating the loss of carbon organic compounds and enhancing the secondary metabolites during tobacco leaves aging process.},

abstract={Animals share an intimate and life-long partnership with a myriad of resident microbial species, collectively referred to as the microbiota. Symbiotic microbes have been shown to regulate nutrition and metabolism and are critical for the development and function of the immune system. More recently, studies have suggested that gut bacteria can impact neurological outcomes--altering behavior and potentially affecting the onset and/or severity of nervous system disorders. In this review, we highlight emerging evidence that the microbiome extends its influence to the brain via various pathways connecting the gut to the central nervous system. While understanding and appreciation of a gut microbial impact on neurological function is nascent, unraveling gut-microbiome-brain connections holds the promise of transforming the neurosciences and revealing potentially novel etiologies for psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders},
